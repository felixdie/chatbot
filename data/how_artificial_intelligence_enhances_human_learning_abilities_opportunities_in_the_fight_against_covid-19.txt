1. 
Introduction 
A 
cough 
on 
the 
phone: 
it 
is 
enough 
for 
artificial 
intelligence 
(AI) 
to 
recognise 
asymptomatic 
people 
carrying 
the 
SarsCoV2 
virus. 
In 
fact, 
a 
characteristic 
sound 
comes 
out 
of 
their 
mouths 
that, 
although 
it 
is 
indistinguishable 
by 
the 
human 
ear, 
does 
not 
escape 
the 
algorithm 
developed 
by 
researchers. 
Its 
success 
rate 
is 
close 
to 
100% 
for 
asymptomatic 
patients 
(Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 
Technology 
2020). 
By 
analysing 
an 
audio 
stream 
containing 
a 
short 
conversation, 
processing 
it 
through 
personal 
devices 
(smartphones, 
tablets, 
and 
computers), 
Neosperience 
Cloud 
Health 
can 
identify 
people 
who 
present 
the 
characteristic 
sounds 
of 
the 
coronavirus 
infection 
(Neosperience 
2020). 


During 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
other 
AI-based 
solutions 
have 
been 
developed 
(Budd 
et 
al. 
2020, 
Bullock 
et 
al. 
2020) 
to 
support 
human 
actors 
in 
healthcare, 
such 
as 
the 
elaboration 
of 
images 
and 
proposals 
for 
preventive 
and 
predictive 
care 
(Rahman 
et 
al. 
2020, 
Ting 
et 
al. 
2020). 
There 
has 
been 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
different 
forms 
of 
AI 
equal 
to 
a 
35% 
increase 
compared 
with 
2019 
(McKinsey 
and 
Company 
2020). 
AI-based 
solutions 
can 
be 
briefly 
described 
as 
the 
capability 
of 
machines 
to 
act 
as 
intelligently 
as 
humans 
(McCarthy 
et 
al. 
2006). 
These 
machines 
can 
acquire, 
interpret, 
and 
learn 
from 
data 
to 


accomplish 
tasks, 
emulating 
human 
cognition 
and 
behaviour 
(Jarrahi 
2018, 
Kaplan 
and 
Haenlein 
2019). 


For 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
paper, 
we 
use 
the 
terms 
intelligent 
machines 
and 
AI-based 
solutions 
(or 
devices) 
to 
describe 
networked 
technology 
interfaces 
that 
can 
learn 
from 
data, 
information, 
and 
experiences 
(Meuter 
et 
al. 
2003, 
Porter 
and 
Heppelmann 
2014) 
for 
the 
elaboration 
and 
identification 
of 
probable 
solutions. 


In 
service 
research, 
scholars 
have 
begun 
to 
question 
how 
AI-driven 
solutions 
could 
affect 
services 
(Huang 
and 
Rust 
2017), 
igniting 
a 
debate 
about 
AI’scontribution 
to 
human 
activities 
(Brynjolfsson 
and 
Mcafee 
2017, 
Von 
Krogh 
2018). 
Studies 
have 
analysed 
the 
learning 
abilities 
of 
AI, 
facilitating 
the 
process 
of 
resource 
integration 
(Mele 
et 
al. 
2021) 
or 
customer 
engagement 
(Huang 
and 
Rust 
2021). 
The 
increasing 
interest 
lies 
in 
analysing 
effects 
on 
service 
provision 
or 
experience 
thanks 
to 
automation 
or 
augmentation 
provided 
by 
smart 
solutions 
(Wirtz 
2020,Heller 
et 
al. 
2021,Mele 
et 
al. 
2021). 
A 
major 
part 
of 
the 
analysis 
focuses 
on 
how 
AI 
technologies 
“learn 
to 
learn” 
and 
provide 
support 
to 
humans 
in 
their 
daily 
activities 
(Yang 
et 
al. 
2019)—although 
a 
negative 
view 
reports 
that 
AI 
can 
also 
threaten 
human 
jobs 
(Huang 
and 
Rust 
2018). 


This 
paper 
widens 
the 
focus 
on 
the 
learning 
abilities 
of 
AI 
and 
moves 
to 
understanding 
how 
AI 
can 
foster

the 
learning 
abilities 
of 
human 
actors 
(Nguyen 
et 
al. 
2020), 
adopting 
a 
wider 
view 
to 
a 
previously 
strict 
focus 
on 
tasks 
and 
activities. 
The 
interaction 
between 
AI 
and 
human 
learning 
has 
not 
been 
investigated 
in 
service 
research. 
Placing 
its 
theoretical 
roots 
in 
the 
work 
by 
Huang 
and 
Rust 
(2021) 
in 
service 
research 
and 
on 
Bloom’s 
revised 
taxonomy 
in 
education 
studies 
(Anderson 
et 
al. 
2001), 
this 
study 
offers 
an 
integrative 
framework 
into 
the 
ways 
AI 
enhances 
human 
learning 
abilities. 
Some 
cases 
in 
the 
context 
of 
COVID-19 
offer 
insightful 
illustrations 
of 
the 
framework. 


The 
remainder 
of 
the 
article 
proceeds 
as 
follows. 
First, 
we 
present 
the 
methodology. 
Second, 
we 
review 
the 
literature 
on 
AI 
in 
service 
science 
and 
human 
learning 
abilities. 
Third, 
we 
present 
the 
integrative 
framework; 
finally, 
we 
discuss 
our 
main 
contributions, 
present 
implications, 
and 
offer 
avenues 
for 
further 
research. 


2. 
Methodology 
To 
investigate 
a 
novel 
phenomenon, 
we 
chose 
to 
develop 
a 
conceptual 
paper, 
as 
this 
type 
of 
research 
enables 
theory-building 
unrestricted 
by 
the 
demands 
of 
empirical 
generalisation 
(Jaakkola 
et 
al. 
2020). 
A 
conceptual 
paper 
does 
not 
propose 
a 
new 
theory 
(Gilson 
and 
Goldberg 
2015). 
However, 
it 
may 
bridge 
existing 
theories, 
working 
across 
disciplines 
and 
providing 
multilevel 
insights 
to 
broaden 
the 
scope 
of 
thinking. 


Our 
argument 
involved 
the 
assimilation 
and 
combination 
of 
evidence 
in 
the 
form 
of 
previously 
developed 
concepts 
and 
theories. 
We 
follow 
an 
adaptation 
approach 
(MacInnis 
2011) 
consisting 
of 
developing 
contributions 
on 
AI-based 
learning 
processes 
by 
introducing 
alternative 
frames 
of 
reference. 
We 
initially 
drew 
on 
AI 
in 
service 
literature 
(Huang 
and 
Rust 
2018, 
2021; 
Perez-Vega 
et 
al. 
2021; 
Stahl 
et 
al. 
2021) 
and 
complemented 
that 
with 
insights 
from 
the 
human 
learning 
approach 
(Bloom 
1956, 
Anderson 
and 
Krathwohl 
2001, 
Crowe 
et 
al. 
2008). 


The 
focus 
was 
on 
connecting 
previously 
differentiated 
categories 
to 
expand 
the 
multifaceted 
issue 
of 
AI 
learning. 
The 
work 
is 
in 
line 
with 
MacInnis’s(2011,p. 


24) 
integration 
process 
that 
involves 
synthesis—“the 
way 
to 
find 
an 
overarching 
idea 
that 
can 
accommodate 
previous 
findings, 
resolve 
contradictions 
or 
puzzles, 
and 
produce 
novel 
perspectives 
that 
accommodate 
complexity” 
(MacInnis 
2011, 
p. 
24). 
This 
process 
also 
highlights 
directions 
for 
future 
inquiry 
beyond 
summarising 
recent 
research 
(Gilson 
and 
Goldberg 
2015). 
To 
make 
our 
framework 
more 
robust, 
we 
use 
illustrations 
involving 
actors 
using 
AI-based 
solutions 
to 
tackle 
COVID-19. 


Illustrations 
come 
from 
cases 
used 
to 
illuminate 
the 
core 
categories 
of 
the 
developed 
framework 
(Gummesson 
2005). 
Scholars 
consider 
that 
case 
studies 
can 
be 
adopted 
as 
illustrations 
of 
conceptual 
contributions 


(MacInnis 
2011, 
Taillard 
et 
al. 
2016), 
in 
which 
their 
role 
is 
to 
help 
readers 
to 
see 
“how 
the 
conceptual 
argument 
might 
actually 
be 
applied 
to 
one 
or 
more 
empirical 
settings” 
(Siggelkow 
2007, 
p. 
22). 


We 
developed 
a 
two-step 
process 
to 
acquire 
appropriate 
illustrations. 
A 
first 
step 
involved 
direct 
encounters 
with 
15 
members 
of 
top 
management 
in 
technology 
firms 
and 
7 
digital 
transformation 
specialists. 
They 
provided 
us 
with 
preliminary 
insights 
into 
the 
way 
AI 
learns 
(or 
acts 
as 
a 
learner). 
The 
interviews, 
conducted 
through 
Webex 
or 
Skype, 
had 
a 
range 
of 
45–60 
minutes. 
The 
second 
step 
involved 
52 
users 
of 
AI-based 
solutions 
who 
were 
interviewed 
to 
gain 
an 
understanding 
of 
people’s 
thoughts 
and 
behaviours 
concerning 
whether, 
and 
if 
so 
how, 
AI 
supports 
human 
learning 
abilities.

3.1. 
AI 
in 
Service 
Science 
A 
seminal 
work 
on 
AI 
addresses 
the 
proposition 
that 
“every 
aspect 
of 
learning 
or 
any 
other 
feature 
of 
intelligencecan 
in 
principlebeso 
precisely 
described 
that 
a 
machine 
can 
be 
made 
to 
simulate 
it” 
(McCarthy 
et 
al. 
2006,p.1). 
This 
includes 
language,forming 
abstractions 
and 
concepts, 
problem-solving, 
pattern 
recognition, 
and 
adapting 
to 
changing 
circumstances 
(Russo 
Spena 
et 
al. 
2019). 
Following 
this 
perspective, 
service 
scholars 
define 
intelligent 
machines 
as 
capable 
of 
learning 
(Huang 
and 
Rust 
2018, 
Perez-Vega 
et 
al. 
2021,Stahl 
et 
al. 
2021). 
The 
debate 
as 
to 
how 
AI 
and 
its 
learning 
abilities 
affect 
the 
service 
context 
is 
rapidly 
emerging 
(Meyer 
et 
al. 
2020,Allal-Ch´

erif 
et 
al. 
2021,Rodgers 
et.al. 
2021). 


Huang 
and 
Rust 
(2018) 
developed 
a 
first 
framework 
depicting 
“four 
intelligences” 
required 
for 
service 
tasks—mechanical, 
analytical, 
intuitive, 
and 
empathetic—
and 
asserting 
“that 
AI 
job 
replacement 
occurs 
fundamentally 
at 
the 
task 
level, 
rather 
than 
the 
job 
level, 
and 
for 
“lower” 
(easier 
for 
AI) 
intelligence 
tasks 
first” 
(p. 
155). 
Subsequently, 
these 
authors 
upgrade 
the 
framework 
into 
three 
main 
categories 
to 
address 
how 
to 
engage 
customers 
for 
different 
service 
benefits 
(Huang 
and 
Rust 
2021): 
mechanical, 
thinking, 
and 
feeling. 
Each 
intelligence 
is 
characterised 
by 
its 
specific 
nature 
and 
supports 
different 
tasks 
(see 
Table 
1). 
We 
use 
this 
categorisation 
to 
offer 
a 
review 
of 
AI 
in 
service 
research 
(LeCun 
et 
al. 
2015, 
Garry 
and 
Harwood 
2019,Langley 
et 
al. 
2020). 


3.1.1. 
Mechanical 
Intelligence. 
Intelligent 
machines 
can 
perform 
mechanical 
and 
repetitive 
tasks 
with 
relatively 
limited 
amounts 
of 
learning 
or 
adaptation 
(Dawar 
and 
Bendle 
2018). 
Advances 
in 
deep 
learning 
have 
improved 
data 
processing 
capacity 
(LeCun 
et 
al. 
2015); 
enabling 
mechanical 
intelligence 
to 
operate 
through 
silos 
of 
data 
automatically 
extracted 
from 
text, 
voice, 
and 
images 
to 
generate 
models 
and 
refine 
functions 
based 
on 
real-world 
optimisation.

2019, 
Stahl 
et 
al. 
2021, 
Zhu 
et 
al. 
2021). 
Scholars 
label 
it 
as 
“thinking 
intelligence” 
(Schuller 
2018, 
Huang 
and 
Rust 
2018), 
including 
in 
this 
categorisation 
all 
of 
the 
intelligent 
machines 
that 
can 
analyse 
and 
make 
decisions 
rationally 
and 
that 
involve 
learning 
and 
adapting 
systematically 
(Chung 
et 
al. 
2009, 
2016). 
It 
churns 
through 
vast 
amounts 
of 
data, 
searches 
for 
dependencies 
in 
it, 
and 
takes 
action 
(Heinonen 
and 
Strandvik 
2020). 
This 
type 
of 
intelligence 
enables 
complex, 
strategic 
decision 
making 
in 
an 
unpredictable 
environment 
(Wedel 
and 
Kannan 
2016) 
and 
could 
be 
capable 
of 
helping 
to 
resolve 
complex 
problems 
to 
facilitate 
decision 
making 
(Albrecht 
et 
al. 
2021). 
Thinking 
intelligence 
can 
address 
the 
situation 
that 
was 
previously 
unsolvable 
or 
establish 
scenarios 
and 
suggest 
the 
best 
performance 
and 
the 
lowest 
risks 
(Allal-
Cherif´ et 
al. 
2021). 
Thinking 
intelligence 
connects 
people 
and 
organisations, 
and 
smart 
devices 
offer 
opportunities 
for 
augmentation 
(Mele 
et 
al. 
2021) 
and 
greater 
productivity 
(Paschen 
et 
al. 
2020). 
Such 
a 
level 
of 
AI 
prompts 
new 
service 
provision 
and 
the 
emergence 
of 
well-informed 
interactions 
between 
humans 
and 
nonhumans 
thanks 
to 
the 
enhanced 
state 
of 
problem-solving 
abilities 
(Huang 
and 
Rust 
2018). 


3.1.3. 
Feeling 
Intelligence. 
The 
ability 
to 
support 
the 
development 
of 
emotion-based 
interactions 
between 
humans 
and 
nonhumans 
is 
defined 
as 
“feeling 
intelligence”; 
and 
it 
refers 
to 
all 
machines 
with 
the 
potential 
to 
recognise, 
emulate, 
and 
respond 
appropriately 
to 
human 
emotions 
(Schuller 
2018). 
The 
ability 
to 
mimic 
empathy 
and 
offer 
emotional 
support—defined 
as 
a 
personalized 
relationship—makes 
it 
ideal 
for 
service 
relation 
(Bolton 
et 
al. 
2018, 
Huang 
and 
Rust 
2018). 
Feeling 
intelligence 
not 
only 
invokes 
judgements 
or 
regulates 
emotions 
(Drigas 
and 
Papoutsi 
2018) 
but 
also 
learns 
and 
adapts 
from 
associated 
experiences. 
It 
can 
be 
inspired 
by 
intuition 
and 
reflective 
practice 
among

its 
users, 
requiring 
recognition 
of 
a 
complex 
system 
between 
culture 
and 
human 
responsiveness 
(Taylor 
and 
Taylor 
2021). 
For 
example, 
social 
robots 
seem 
to 
improve 
both 
the 
physical 
and 
psychosocial 
wellbeing 
of 
people 
interacting 
with 
them, 
when 
they 
learn 
and 
manage 
to 
master 
empathy 
and 
social 
sensitivity 
(Odekerken-Schr¨

oder 
et 
al. 
2020). 
The 
focus 
on 
social 
robots 
in 
elder 
care 
services 
shows 
ways 
in 
which 
their 
humanlike 
affect 
and 
cognition 
influence 
users’ 
social 
perceptions 
and 
lead 
to 
anticipation 
of 
their 
potential—
both 
negative 
and 
positive—for

(

Cai´ 

In 
sum, 
the 
technological 
developments 
described 
above 
gave 
rise 
to 
the 
need 
to 
understand 
not 
simply 
how 
AI 
learns 
but 
how 
it 
can 
support 
humans 
in 
their 
learning 
abilities 
(Nguyen 
et 
al. 
2020). 
To 
accomplish 
this 
aim, 
we 
move 
to 
the 
literature 
on 
human 
learning 
abilities 
(Anderson 
et 
al. 
2001). 


3.2. 
Human 
Learning 
Abilities 
Learning 
is 
the 
process 
through 
which 
humans 
acquire 
knowledge 
and 
develop 
skills 
or 
abilities 
(Zhou 
et 
al. 
2019). 
Research 
into 
the 
learning 
process 
and 
human 
abilities 
is 
wide 
and 
integrates 
insights 
across 
multiple 
fields, 
from 
the 
biological 
and 
neurosciences 
to 
psychology, 
sociology, 
and 
developmental 
and 
learning 
sciences. 


In 
educational 
studies, 
consensus 
about 
the 
science 
of 
learning 
and 
development 
has 
increased 
since 
the 
publication 
of 
Bloom’s 
research 
in 
1956 
concerning 
the 
learning 
ability 
and 
motivation 
for 
further 
learning. 
Based 
on 
their 
understanding 
of 
conditions 
under 
which 
the 
learning 
process 
is 
favoured, 
Bloom 
et 
al. 
(1956) 
recognise 
the 
existence 
of 
three 
domains 
of 
learning: 
cognitive 
(knowledge), 
affective 
(attitude 
or 
self), 
psychomotor 
(skills). 
They 
also 
develop 
a 
taxonomy 
for 
the 
cognitive 
domain 
as 
it 
involves 
knowledge; 
this 
includes 
the 
recall 
or 
recognition 
of 
specific 
facts, 
procedural 
patterns, 
and 
concepts 
that 
serve 
in 
the 
development 
of 
intellectual 
abilities 
and 
skills 
(Bloom 
et 
al. 
1956). 
The 
other 
two 
domains 
were 
developed 
by 
Bloom 
and 
coauthors 
later 
(Bloom 
et 
al. 
1956,Simpson 
1972,Krathwohl 
et 
al. 
1973), 
although 
scholars 
recognise 
that 
it 
does 
not 
seem 
possible 
to 
artificially 
separate 
the 
cognitive 
and 
affective 
aspectsoflearning. 


There 
are 
six 
classes 
relating 
to 
the 
cognitive 
domain: 
knowledge, 
comprehension, 
application, 
analysis, 
synthesis, 
and 
evaluation. 
Since 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Bloom 
et 
al. 
work 
in 
1956, 
several 
weaknesses 
have 
been 
identified, 
particularly 
that 
each 
level 
was 
a 
prerequisitefor 
thenext 
and 
that 
thehigher 
levels 
contain 
all 
of 
the 
cognitive 
abilities 
of 
the 
lower 
ones 
(Krathwohl 
2002). 
Also 
identified 
was 
the 
lack 
of 
constructivist 
integration 
(Granello 
2001). 
In 
response, 
Anderson 
et 
al. 
(2001) 
have 
proposed 
a 
revised 
version 
composed 
of 
six 
cognitive 
action-verbs, 
rather 
than 
concept-based 


nouns, 
pointing 
to 
a 
more 
dynamic 
classification 
and 
reflecting 
a 
more 
active 
form 
of 
thinking. 
Each 
level 
includes 
different 
human 
skills 
to 
be 
engaged 
in 
active 
cognitive 
processing: 
“a 
meaningful 
learning 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
view 
of 
learning 
as 
knowledge 
construction, 
in 
which 
(actors) 
seek 
to 
make 
sense 
of 
their 
experiences” 
(Anderson 
et 
al. 
2001,p.65). 


The 
action-verb 
“remember” 
represents 
the 
simplest 
cognitive 
activities, 
and 
it 
is 
referred 
to 
as 
retrieving 
related 
knowledge 
from 
long-term 
memory. 
The 
remembering 
action 
implies 
the 
recall 
or 
recognition 
of 
information 
based 
on 
the 
memorising 
capability 
of 
human 
actors 
(Anderson 
et 
al. 
2001). 
Through 
it, 
human 
actors 
are 
able 
to 
recollect 
concepts 
as 
presented 
and 
can 
develop 
knowledge 
with 
the 
help 
of 
relevant 
data 
(Crowe 
et 
al. 
2008). 


“Understanding” 
is 
the 
ability 
to 
extract 
meaning 
from 
the 
data 
(Poluakan 
et 
al. 
2019). 
According 
to 
Pepin 
et 
al. 
(2021), 
the 
understanding 
action 
implies 
the 
construction 
of 
meaning 
from 
the 
information 
that 
human 
actors 
have 
at 
their 
disposal. 
This 
ability 
also 
includes 
building 
connections 
between 
newly 
introduced 
and 
prior 
knowledge. 
Through 
it, 
human 
actors 
can 
interpret, 
classify, 
summarise, 
and 
compare 
information 
(Ulmeanu 
et 
al. 
2019). 


“Apply” 
refers 
to 
using 
a 
learned 
procedure 
in 
new 
conditions 
(Anderson 
et 
al. 
2001). 
Abilities 
involve 
transferring 
knowledge 
or 
understanding 
to 
another 
task, 
be 
it 
familiar 
or 
not 
(Ben-Zvi 
2004). 
Through 
the 
application 
of 
relevant 
information, 
human 
actors 
are 
enabled 
to 
integrate 
information, 
make 
it 
more 
complete, 
and 
to 
develop 
ideas 
(Ben-Zvi 
2004). 


“Analyse” 
is 
the 
ability 
to 
make 
connections 
between 
data,information,and 
ideas 
(Wang 
et 
al. 
2021). 
The 
analysing 
ability 
consists 
of 
breaking 
down 
a 
concept 
into 
its 
constituent 
parts 
and 
determining 
the 
relation 
between 
them 
and 
an 
overall 
structure 
(Wang 
et 
al. 
2021). 
Throughit, 
humanactors 
can 
determine 
the 
significant 
elements 
of 
information 
and 
concept 
(differentiating), 
determining 
how 
these 
elements 
are 
organised 
(organising) 
and 
determining 
their 
reason 
and 
significance 
(interpreting) 
(Canziani 
and 
Welsh 
2019). 


The 
evaluation 
of 
the 
results 
enables 
human 
actors 
to 
make 
judgements 
based 
on 
criteria 
or 
standards, 
through 
a 
continuous 
process 
of 
reviewing 
and 
critiquing 
(Zhang 
et 
al. 
2019). 
The 
“evaluate” 
involves 
exercising 
judgement, 
spotting 
inappropriate 
or 
missing 
elements, 
and 
demonstrating 
critical 
thinking. 
This 
taxonomic 
level 
involves 
the 
cognitive 
processes 
of 
checking 
(making 
judgements 
about 
internal 
consistency) 
and 
critiquing 
(making 
judgements 
based 
on 
external 
criteria) 
(Thote 
and 
Gowri 
2020). 


Finally, 
to 
put 
all 
the 
elements 
together 
to 
form 
a 
new 
context 
is 
possible 
using 
the 
highest 
form 
of 
learning 
known 
as 
“creating” 
(Gelmez 
and 
Bagli 
2018). 
The 
ability 
to 
generate, 
plan, 
and 
process 
data 
and 
information

enables 
human 
actors 
to 
create 
information, 
to 
investigate 
other 
processes, 
and 
to 
explore 
new 
solutions 
(Thote 
and 
Gowri 
2020, 
Waite 
et 
al. 
2020). 


Bloom’s 
revised 
taxonomy 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
widely 
used 
methods 
to 
analyse 
the 
human 
learning 
process 
(Lahuerta-Otero 
and 
alez-Bravo 
2017). 
It

Gonz´ has 
been 
used 
in 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
applications 
with 
simplified 
contextualisation 
(Crowe 
et 
al. 
2008) 
ranging 
from 
linguistics 
(Koziko

glu 
2018), 
business 
(Tran 
and 
Anvari 
2013, 
Ulmeanu

2018, 
Canziani 
and 
Welsh 
2019, 
Clement 
and

It 
has 
also 
been 
applied 
to 
various 
situations 
describing 
everything 
from 
analysing 
games 
(Haring 
et 
al. 
2018) 
to 
designing 
learning 
for 
mobile 
applications 
(Ekren 
and 
Keskin 
2017). 


In 
this 
study, 
Bloom’s 
revised 
taxonomy 
is 
used 
to 
understand 
key 
aspects 
of 
human 
learning 
abilities 
as 
enhanced 
by 
AI. 


4. 
An 
Integrative 
Framework 
Our 
literature 
review 
highlights 
the 
ever-growing 
scholarly 
interest 
in 
the 
idea 
that 
artificial 
intelligence 
can 
take 
over 
human 
roles 
(Brynjolfsson 
and 
Mcafee 
2017, 
Von 
Krogh 
2018). 
Recent 
advances 
in 
AI 
enable 
the 
processing 
of 
a 
vast 
amount 
of 
data 
and 
translation 
of 
useful 
information 
into 
specified 
actions. 
“Feature 
extraction” 
carried 
out 
by 
AI 
has 
made 
it 
possible 
to 
pinpoint 
significant 
facts 
that 
would 
otherwise 
have 
been 
missed 
from 
silos 
of 
data 
(Arel 
et 
al. 
2010). 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
using 
data-driven 
insights, 
AI 
can 
act 
rationally. 
Such 
action 
resembles 
the 
characteristic 
reasoning 
and 
thinking 
patterns 
of 
humans 
(Pedersen 
et 
al. 
2018). 


However, 
the 
objective 
is 
not 
to 
substitute 
intelligent 
machines 
for 
human 
actors 
but 
to 
consider 
how 
AI 
can 
offer 
assistance 
to 
human 
cognition 
and 
behaviour. 
Humans 
receive 
data 
every 
day 
and 
capture 
a 
critical 
aspect 
of 
them 
based 
on 
experiences. 
However, 
such 
data 
become 
difficult 
to 
process 
as 
learning 
complexity 
grows 
exponentially 
with 
an 
increase 
in 
number, 
dimension, 
and 
typology 
(Holzinger 
2016). 
There 
is 
a 
need 
to 
move 
from 
AI 
learning 
to 
AI-based 
human 
learning. 


By 
integrating 
the 
model 
by 
Huang 
and 
Rust 
(2021) 
and 
Bloom's 
revised 
taxonomy 
(Anderson 
et 
al. 
2001), 
we 
offer 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
framework 
to 
depict 
how 
AI 
can 
enhance 
human 
learning 
abilities 
(the 
Artificial 
Intelligence-Human 
Learning 
Aabilities 
(AIHLA) 
Framework). 


Our 
framework 
moves 
from 
the 
three 
types 
of 
AI 
categories 
summarised 
by 
Huang 
and 
Rust 
(2018)— 
(AI 
as 
a 
learner)—and 
proposes 
that 
AI 
intelligence 
can 
enhance 
human 
learning 
abilities—(AI 
as 
a 
human 
learning 
enhancer). 
By 
integrating 
the 
model 
by 


Huang 
and 
Rust 
(2021) 
and 
Bloom's 
revised 
taxonomy 
(Anderson 
et 
al. 
2001), 
we 
offer 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
framework 
to 
depict 
how 
human 
actors 
can 
exploit 
mechanical, 
thinking, 
and 
feeling 
to 
boost 
their 
learning 
abilities 
(see 
Table 
3). 


4.1. 
Human 
Learning 
Abilities 
Enhanced 
by 
Mechanical 
Intelligence 
Mechanical 
intelligence 
enables 
automatic 
extraction 
of 
information 
from 
data 
and 
performance 
of 
repetitive 
tasks 
thanks 
to 
observation 
and 
standardisation 
(Huang 
and 
Rust 
2018, 
2021). 
AI’s 
ability 
to 
carry 
out 
repetitive 
functions 
and 
routine 
tasks 
supports 
human 
actors’ 
ability 
to 
manage 
data 
in 
real 
time 
by 
recalling 
relevant 
information 
from 
memory 
and 
enabling 
rapid 
recognition 
(e.g., 
retrieving 
data 
about 
the 
temperature 
of 
an 
individual 
that 
means 
that 
an 
alarm 
must 
be 
raised; 
recognising 
the 
critical 
nature 
of 
the 
data 
instantaneously 
to 
raise 
the 
alarm). 
Further, 
mechanical 
intelligence, 
relying 
on 
observations 
and 
repetitive 
actions, 
enables 
the 
human 
actor 
to 
understand 
across 
the 
data 
by 
comparing 
and 
classifying 
these 
data, 
resulting 
in 
a 
dramatic 
reduction 
in 
error 
(e.g., 
recognising 
observed 
temperature 
as 
either 
critical 
or 
normal). 
The 
use 
of 
machine 
intelligence 
promotes 
higher 
learning 
abilities 
for 
human 
actors 
who 
can 
have 
access 
to 
more 
data 
and 
who 
can 
detect 
correspondences 
between 
data 
and 
information 
in 
a 
short 
time. 
The 
automatic 
mechanical 
observation 
facilitates 
a 
wider 
understanding 
that 
can 
offer 
the 
opportunity 
to 
see 
the 
cause 
and 
effect 
of 
a 
phenomenon. 
In 
sum, 
AI-based 
devices 
can 
be 
tools 
for 
remembering 
and 
managing 
a 
greater 
amount 
of 
data 
in 
real 
time 
more 
easily 
and 
for 
enabling 
a 
wider 
understanding 
across 
data. 


4.2. 
Human 
Learning 
Abilities 
Enhanced 
by 
Thinking 
Intelligence 
Thinking 
intelligence 
can 
analyse 
and 
make 
decisions 
rationally 
and 
involves 
adapting 
systematically 
to 
data 
(Chung 
et

It 
can 
be 
useful 
for 
real-
time 
detection, 
clustering, 
and 
forecasting 
(Rust 
and 
Huang 
2012). 
Thanks 
to 
its 
ability 
to 
discover 
relevant 
data 
and 
information, 
thinking 
intelligence 
can 
support 
human 
actors 
to 
obtain 
information 
and 
check 
their 
decisions. 
Furthermore, 
supported 
by 
systematic 
learning 
based 
on 
the 
data, 
people 
carry 
out 
data 
analysis 
and 
determine 
how 
to 
implement 
the 
best 
solutions 
in 
a 
limited 
time. 
The 
analytical 
and 
forecasting 
skills 
of 
device-based 
thinking 
intelligence 
supports 
human 
actors 
in 
the 
detection 
of 
inconsistencies, 
errors, 
or 
anomalies, 
letting 
them 
identify 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
a 
solution—that 
is 
being 
implemented—in 
novel 
contexts. 
Human 
actors 
can 
apply 
a 
contextual 
procedure 
to 
a 
task 
and 
provide 
a 
logical 
perspective 
(see 
Table 
2). 
In 
sum, 
AI-based 
devices 
can 
be 
a 
tool

Human

Feeling 
intelligence 
focuses 
on 
the 
potential 
of 
AI 
to 
acknowledge 
and 
respond 
appropriately 
to 
human 
emotions 
(Schuller 
2018). 
Such 
an 
approach 
is 
ideal 
for 
a 
personalised 
relationship 
and 
customer 
satisfaction 
and 
retention 
(Huang 
and 
Rust 
2017, 
2018). 
Thanks 
to 
the 
ability 
to 
acknowledge 
human 
emotions, 
AI-based 
solutions 
supports 
human 
actors 
to 
respond 
to 
human 
emotional 
needs 
in 
an 
empathetic 
manner 
based 
on 
prior 
experiences 
(e.g., 
generate 
solutions 
for 
the 
human 
actors 
based 
on 
observed 
emotions-based 
information). 
Further, 
it 
helps 
people 
create 
personalised 
relationships 
for 
accomplishing 
experiential 
tasks 
(e.g., 
plan 
a 
daily 
health-related 
goal 
based 
on 
the 
investigation 
of 
emotion). 
In 
this 
way, 
decision 
making 
is 
incorporated 
with 
emotions 
and 
the 
machine 
helps 
to 
make 
intuitive 
judgements. 
In 
sum, 
this 
type 
of 
intelligence 
enhances 
social 
skills 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
greater 
empathy, 
taking 
into

new 
forms 
of 
human-robot 
interactions.

An 
illustration: 
AI 
and 
Human 
Actors 
Against 
COVID-19 
We 
will 
illustrate 
our 
framework 
in 
terms 
of 
how 
AI 
enhances 
human 
learning 
abilities 
in 
the 
healthcare 
context 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
COVID-19 
(see 
the 
appendix). 


5.1. 
Mechanical 
Intelligence 
and 
the 
Human 
Learning 
Abilities 
of 
Remembering 
and 
Understanding 
During 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
mechanical 
intelligence 
has 
been 
used 
to 
emulate 
human 
repetitive 
tasks 
and 
human 
behaviour 
in 
an 
automatic 
way 
and 
following 
predefined 
protocols. 
In 
this 
process, 
intelligent 


machines 
have 
carried 
out 
‘”COVID-19 
data 
extraction 
activities” 
thanks 
to 
their 
skills 
in 
capturing 
a 
large 
amount 
of 
data 
about 
COVID-19 
infection 
and 
processing 
a 
rapid 
automatic 
combination 
of 
them. 
The 
use 
of 
mechanical 
intelligence 
to 
observe 
a 
large 
amount 
of 
data 
fosters 
the 
skills 
of 
human 
actors 
(e.g., 
doctors, 
researchers, 
nurses, 
and 
police) 
in 
their 
collection 
and 
comparison 
of 
different 
types 
of 
data, 
thus 
enabling 
learning 
abilities 
of 
understanding 
and 
remembering 
COVID-19 
data 
and 
information. 
This 
standardisation 
and 
automation 
of 
activities 
supports 
doctors 
and 
other 
human 
actors 
in 
recalling 
and 
recognising 
significant 
data 
and 
facts. 


An 
example 
is 
the 
AI 
thermometer, 
by 
OpenPose 
technology, 
a 
thermal 
imaging 
camera. 
AI 
thermometer 
is 
able 
to 
extract 
data 
from 
images 
in 
an 
automatic 
manner 
and 
enables 
detection 
of 
the 
position 
and 
posture 
of 
individuals 
in 
the 
frame. 
This 
device 
can 
identify 
people 
through 
a 
standard 
detector 
that 
reads 
the 
body 
shape 
of 
the 
subjects 
and 
then 
locates 
a 
point 
on 
the 
face 
at 
which 
to 
measure 
the 
temperature. 
The 
software 
is 
rule 
based 
and 
relies 
on 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
and 
its 
continuous 
sensor-based 
perception 
to 
observe 
and 
react 
to 
physical 
and 
temporal 
variability. 
Real-time 
data 
are 
registered, 
categorised, 
and 
sent 
to 
the 
app 
through 
Bluetooth 
with 
sound 
notice 
in 
the 
case 
of 
difficult 
situations. 
The 
AI 
thermometer 
does 
not 
understand 
any 
change 
in 
environment 
but 
uses 
algorithms 
to 
identify 
the 
meaning 
of 
data, 
observe 
data, 
and 
return 
the 
appropriate 
results. 
Thus, 
it 
helps 
human 
actors 
to 
remember 
and 
understand 
healthcare 
data. 
For 
humans, 
the 
mechanical 
process 
of 
measuring 
the 
temperature 
of 
skin 
does 
not 
require 
much 
creativity, 
advanced 
training, 
or 
education 
but 
requires 
mostly 
automatic 
skills 
of 
considerable 
importance 
to 
combatting 
the 
COVID-19 
infection. 
The 
intelligent 
device 
supports 
human 
actors, 
sending 
them 
a 
notification 
if 
a 
higher 
temperature 
range 
is 
identified 
and

a 
daily 
list 
of 
health 
data 
about 
the 
users' 
body 
temperature 
to 
support 
human 
actors 
in 
their 
categorisation. 
It 
is 
free 
from 
human 
fatigue 
and 
observes 
the 
environment 
in 
a 
very 
reliable 
manner, 
mapping 
many 
people 
simultaneously. 
The 
nature 
of 
the 
task— 
repetitive 
and 
with 
little 
variation—renders 
learning 
over 
time 
to 
be 
of 
limited 
value—nothing 
new 
to 
learn 
over 
the 
course 
of 
service 
transactions. 
However, 
the 
automated 
process 
enables 
human 
learning 
by 
facilitating 
the 
recall 
and 
recognition 
of 
trends 
in 
healthcare 
data. 
The 
human 
actors, 
thanks 
to 
the 
AI 
thermometer’s 
data 
integration, 
can 
compare 
and 
classify 
large 
volumes 
of 
healthcare 
data 
faster 
than 
ever 
before. 


5.2. 
Thinking 
Intelligence 
and 
the 
Human 
Learning 
Abilities 
of 
Analysing 
and 
Applying 
Thinking 
intelligence 
has 
been 
used 
to 
emulate 
human 
thinking 
tasks 
and 
behaviour, 
analysing 
a 
large 
amount 
of 
data 
in 
a 
limited 
time 
and 
following 
algorithm-based 
machine 
learning 
and 
deep 
learning 
to 
implement 
decision-making 
processes. 
Through 
this 
process, 
AI-based 
devices 
forecast 
options, 
identify 
a 
large 
number 
of 
possible 
solutions 
to 
a 
problem 
(decision 
making), 
and 
analyse 
them 
to 
refine 
them 
for 
different 
contexts. 
Thanks 
to 
its 
ability 
to 
learn 
from 
experience, 
the 
intelligent 
machine 
has 
educated 
itself 
to 
learn 
about 
COVID-19 
infection 
without 
repeating 
the 
same 
mistakes 
twice. 
Such 
features 
of 
thinking 
intelligence 
enable 
human 
actors 
to 
organise 
and 
identify 
data 
correctly 
and 
to 
checkand 
applysolutions 
in 
a 
more 
effective 
way. 
During 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
thinking 
intelligence 
has 
been 
used 
for 
anomaly 
detection, 
clustering, 
and 
association 
modelling. 


An 
example 
is 
IBM 
Summit, 
characterised 
by 
creative 
and 
problem-solving 
abilities. 
In 
the 
exploratory 
phases 
of 
medical 
and 
pharmaceutical 
research, 
it 
has 
been 
particularly 
useful 
for 
accelerating 
the 
research 
phase 
for 
the 
development 
of 
COVID-19–related 
drugs. 
The 
possibility 
of 
analysing 
a 
multiplicity 
of 
data 
from 
different 
sources 
(drug 
monographs, 
reports 
based 
on 
therapeutic 
evidence, 
disease 
monographs, 
scientific 
articles, 
etc.) 
allowed 
increasing 
data-learning 
relating 
to 
the 
phenomenon 
observed, 
and 
its 
evolutions 
also 
in 
different 
contexts, 
highlighting 
effective 
proposals 
for 
the 
treatment 
and 
care 
of 
patients. 
This 
AI-based 
solution 
has 
performed 
a 
range 
of 
tasks 
and 
leverages 
its 
logical 
reasoning 
to 
discover 
facts 
and 
interpret 
data 
for 
effective 
decision 
making 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
COVID-19. 
Thanks 
its 
abilities 
to 
observe 
big 
data, 
and 
analyse 
them 
for 
problem-solving, 
IBM 
Summit 
helps 
human 
actors 
to 
apply 
and 
analyse 
possible 
drug 
solutions: 
its 
automated 
process 
identified 
77 
potential 
solutions 
in 
a 
much 
wider 
range 
within 
a 
few 
days, 
performing 
a 
range 
of 
analytics 
tasks 
requested 
by 
humans 
and 
leveraging 
their 
logical 
reasoning 
to 
refine 
these 
for 


different 
contexts. 
IBM 
Summit 
enhances 
the 
human 
learning 
ability 
to 
organize 
data: 
humans 
can 
then 
consider 
the 
best 
solutions 
among 
those 
identified, 
with 
forecasts 
about 
their 
implications, 
by 
the 
automated

5.3. 
Feeling 
Intelligence 
and 
the 
Human 
Learning 
Abilities 
of 
Evaluating 
and 
Creating 
During 
COVID-19, 
feeling 
intelligence 
has 
been 
used 
to 
acknowledge 
actors’ 
emotions, 
respond 
appropriately 
emotionally, 
influence 
others’ 
emotions, 
and 
support 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
patterns 
of 
interactions 
and 
relationships. 
Characterised 
by 
affective 
computing, 
these 
devices 
can 
learn 
the 
communication 
style 
of 
an 
individual 
and 
adapt 
empathetically 
based 
on 
prior 
experiences. 
They 
also 
offer 
decision 
making 
that 
incorporates 
emotions 
and 
facilitate 
relationship 
building 
during 
their 
interactions. 
They 
offer 
interactive 
support 
using 
the 
interpersonal 
and 
social 
features 
of 
humans 
for 
the 
enhancement 
of 
their 
well-being. 
Feeling 
intelligence 
has 
helped 
human 
actors 
to 
formulate 
and 
detect 
the 
emotions-related 
details 
of 
an 
individual 
in 
a 
deeper 
way 
to 
offer 
support 
and 
to 
respond 
in 
time. 
In 
the 
creation 
of 
possible 
supports 
against 
COVID-19, 
the 
focus 
stays 
on 
the 
empathetic 
and 
emotional 
dimensions 
of 
the 
person. 


Laila 
is 
a 
chatbot 
that 
includes 
interpersonal 
and 
social 
skills 
that 
can 
support 
humans 
in 
stressful 
situations 
during 
the 
pandemic. 
Laila 
can 
learn 
from 
experience, 
recognise 
and 
acknowledge 
other 
actors’ 
emotions, 
respond 
appropriately 
emotionally, 
influence 
others’ 
emotions, 
and 
extract 
new 
information 
based 
on 
the 
analysis 
of 
data. 
This 
social 
robot 
shows 
that 
the 
capacity 
to 
assemble 
data 
can 
lead 
to 
the 
generation 
of 
new 
information 
in 
a 
complex 
context 
where 
it 
can 
produce 
and

supporting 
and 
enhancing 
their

and 
to 
process 
emotional 
details. 
This 
intelligent 
application 
can 
act 
as

it 
has 
created, 
improving 
the

6. 
Conclusion 
This 
paper 
focuses 
on 
how 
AI 
enhances 
human 
learning 
abilities. 
Moving 
from 
different 
types 
of 
intelligent 
machines 
as 
detected 
in 
service 
research 
and 
using 
Bloom's 
revised 
taxonomy, 
we 
offer 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
framework, 
with 
illustrations 
taken 
from 
AI-based 
solutions 
developed 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
COVID-19. 
Our 
work 
makes 
two 
contributions. 
First, 
we 
argue 
that 
scholars 
need 
to 
understand 
not 
simply 
how 
AI 
learns 
but 
how 
it 
can 
support 
humans 
in 
their 
learning 
abilities. 
To 
be 
specific, 
the 
mechanical 
intelligence 
carries 
out 
automatic 
COVID-19 
data 
extraction 
using 
its 
AI 
skills 
to 
observe 
data 
and 
standardize

activities. 
These 
features 
enable 
AI 
to 
enhance 
human 
learning 
abilities 
to 
recall 
and 
recognise 
information 
but 
also 
to 
compare 
and 
classify 
important 
data. 
In 
summary, 
AI 
fosters 
human 
actors’ 
ability 
to 
remember 
and 
understand 
information 
promptly. 
The 
thinking 
intelligence 
carried 
out 
data 
processing 
activities 
thanks 
to 
the 
AI 
skills 
of 
data 
analysis, 
forecasting 
information, 
and 
developing 
decision-making 
processes. 
Such 
processes 
enable 
AI 
to 
enhance 
the 
human 
learning 
capability 
to 
conduct 
detailed 
analysis 
and 
further 
select 
the 
best 
possible 
solution 
for 
the 
contextual 
application 
of 
data. 
They 
can 
implement 
solutions 
in 
different 
contexts, 
check 
the 
best 
solutions, 
and 
organise 
information 
to 
support 
the 
evaluation 
activities 
that 
humans 
will 
conduct. 
Finally, 
the 
feeling 
intelligence 
carried 
out 
features 
extraction 
activities 
that 
use 
its 
learning 
skills 
to 
acknowledge 
and 
emulate 
emotions. 
AI 
can 
enhance 
human 
learning 
by 
assisting 
empathic 
decision 
making, 
planning 
goals, 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
emotionally 
driven 
solutions. 
As 
a 
result, 
intelligent 
machines 
not 
only 
provide 
access 
to 
resources 
allowing 
the 
human 
actor 
to 
have 
relevant 
information 
at 
their 
fingertips 
but 
also 
supports 
the 
decision-making 
processes. 


Second, 
in 
line 
with 
Nguyen 
et 
al. 
(2020), 
our 
study 
addresses 
the 
potential 
of 
AI 
to 
utilise 
learning 
abilities 
to 
drive 
mechanical, 
thinking, 
and 
feeling 
intelligence 
to 
manage 
the 
COVID-19 
outbreak. 
Rather 
than 
understanding 
situations 
in 
which 
mechanical 
intelligence 
is 
used 
for 
effective 
automation 
of 
services 
(Garry 
and 
Harwood 
2019) 
and 
their 
standardisation 
(Huang 
and 
Rust 
2018, 
2021) 
with 
complete 
substitution 
of 
human 
actors, 
this 
study 
offers 
an 
understanding 
of 
how 
the 
mechanical 
intelligence 
collaborates 
with 
human 
actors 
in 
healthcare 
where 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
understand 
and 
remember 
data 
and 
information 
in 
a 
more 
profound 
manner. 
This 
combination 
allows 
for 
the 
identification 
of 
significant 
facts 
that 
would 
otherwise 
have 
been 
lost. 


In 
a 
similar 
way, 
thinking 
intelligence 
allows 
meeting 
the 
need 
to 
analyse 
how 
the 
machines 
help 
human 
actors 
to 
resolve 
complex 
problems, 
facilitating 
decision 
making 
in 
the 
healthcare 
context 
(Albrecht 
et 
al. 
2021). 
Broadening 
the 
understanding 
of 
Huang 
and 
Rust 
(2018, 
2021)who 
showed 
that 
thinking 
intelligence 
enables 
service 
personalisation, 
this 
study 
offers 
an 
understanding 
of 
how 
thinking 
intelligence 
collaborates 
with 
human 
actors 
in 
healthcare 
emergency 
situations 
where 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
elaborate 
a 
more 
detailed 
analysis 
to 
evaluate 
and 
create 
the 
best 
solution 
to 
the 
problem, 
in 
a 
contextual 
manner. 
This 
combination 
allows 
for 
a 
more 
efficient 
decision-making 
process. 


Our 
study 
of 
machines 
with 
feeling 
intelligence 
allowed 
us 
to 
analyse 
how 
these 
AI-based 
devices 


help 
human 
actors 
to 
develop 
service 
interaction 
based 
on 
emotion 
(Schuller 
2018). 
It 
has 
shown 
that 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
feeling 
intelligence 
to 
learn 
from 
emotional 
data 
and 
emotional 
experience 
has 
helped 
human 
actors 
to 
offer 
support 
and 
react 
in 
time. 
This 
combination 
allows 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
human 
actors’ 
abilities 
to 
make 
decisions 
about 
emotional 
service 
interactions. 


In 
sum, 
the 
framework 
satisfies 
the 
need 
to 
understand 
how 
AI 
influences 
the 
activities 
that 
make 
up 
the 
learning 
process, 
as 
listed 
by 
Bloom's 
revised 
taxonomy 
(Greiner 
et 
al. 
2021). 
In 
line 
with 
Perez-Vega 
et 
al. 
(2021), 
the 
use 
of 
richer 
theories 
that 
aim 
to 
explain 
human 
behaviour 
can 
beappropriateto 
guide 
thedevelopment 
of 
applications 
for 
new 
technologies, 
especially 
because 
these 
technologies 
are 
designed 
to 
emulate 
humanlike 
responses. 


7. 
Implications 
for 
Practitioners 
This 
study 
contributes 
to 
the 
understanding 
of 
how 
to 
improve 
human 
learning 
abilities 
thanks 
to 
AI-based 
technology. 
Important 
implications 
arise. 


First, 
professionals 
should 
foster 
the 
combination 
of 
the 
AI 
and 
human 
actors’ 
learning 
abilities, 
designing 
services 
that 
promote 
the 
integration 
of 
intelligent 
machines 
as 
a 
learning 
enhancer. 
To 
do 
this, 
they 
must 
have 
a 
strong 
understanding 
of 
the 
context, 
and 
of 
the 
features 
of 
intelligent 
machines, 
to 
ensure 
their 
effective 
use 
and 
integration 
into 
the 
human 
actor’s 
learning 
process. 


Second, 
the 
COVID 
healthcare 
emergency 
requires 
a 
shift 
toward 
participatory 
and 
predictive 
care, 
including 
a 
more 
feeling-centred 
approach 
that 
is 
personalised, 
contextualised, 
connected, 
and 
data 
and 
information 
driven. 
Practitioners 
should 
recognise 
the 
importance 
of 
acting 
promptly 
after 
receiving 
the 
emotional 
information 
to 
implement 
effective 
predictive 
solutions. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
insights 
offered 
by 
this 
study 
could 
further 
help 
practitioners 
allocate 
required 
resources 
and 
workforce 
as 
required 
by 
the 
different 
types 
of 
tasks. 
Practitioners 
would 
beableto 
harness 
thepower 
of 
AI 
to 
improve 
the 
accuracy 
of 
mechanical 
tasks, 
make 
robust 
predictions 
with 
thinking 
tasks, 
and 
enable 
empathic 
responses 
for 
feeling 
tasks 
in 
services. 


Third, 
considering 
how 
COVID-19 
has 
exhausted 
healthcare 
resources 
and 
outpaced 
medical 
facilities, 
practitioners 
should 
foster 
the 
application 
of 
AI 
while 
dealing 
with 
this 
pandemic 
(Abd-Alrazaq 
et 
al. 
2020). 
Thesamestands 
true 
for 
the 
peoplewho 
have 
had 
considerably 
restricted 
access 
to 
healthcare 
facilities 
because 
ofthe 
emergence 
ofthe 
coronavirus. 
Considering 
the 
constraints 
on 
the 
resources 
and 
accessibility 
of 
healthcare 
(caused 
by 
COVID-19), 
AI 
can 
identify 
anomalies, 
analyse 
the 
data, 
and 
support 
people 
during

the 
pandemic 
to 
have 
a 
better 
understanding 
of 
the 
virus. 


Finally, 
with 
its 
success 
in 
areas 
like 
disease 
diagnosis, 
treatment, 
patient 
monitoring, 
drug 
discovery, 
epidemiology, 
and 
more, 
AI 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
an 
indispensable 
and 
pervasive 
tool 
in 
the 
post-
pandemic 
world 
(Khosla 
2020, 
Hanaba 
et 
al. 
2021). 
The 
application 
of 
AI 
manifests 
patient-centric 
preventive 
healthcare. 
It 
can 
act 
as 
a 
tool 
to 
support 
public 
health 
experts 
worldwide 
in 
their 
efforts 
to 
keep 
people 
safe 
and 
informed 
amid 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
It 
further 
enables 
scientists, 
policymakers, 
and 
healthcare 
professionals 
to 
find 
the 
most 
relevant 
information 
tailored 
to 
their 
questions 
of 
interest 
in 
real 
time 
(Haas 
et 
al. 
2021). 


8. 
Limitation 
and 
Further 
Research 
The 
present 
study 
has 
limitations 
that 
can 
be 
addressed 
in 
future 
research. 
First, 
the 
research 
elaborates 
on 
the 
specific 
features 
of 
intelligent 
machines, 
based 
on 
the 
categorisation 
made 
by 
Huang 
and 
Rust 
(2021); 
but 
their 
applications 
can 
potentially 
combine 
different 
types 
of 
AI. 
Future 
research 
could 
explore 
the 
evolution 
of 
AI 
features 
emerging 
through 
the 
combination 
of 
intelligent 
machines.

Second, 
the 
study 
does 
not 
report 
challenges 
and 
constraints 
in 
the 
learning 
process 
enabled 
by 
AI. 
Other 
studies 
could 
benefit 
from 
observing 
individuals 
as 
they 
proceed 
through 
the 
learning 
phases. 
This 
could 
yield 
more 
profound 
insights 
into 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
effortsrequired 
to 
overcome 
barriersasthe 
learning 
process 
unfolds 
and 
make 
advances 
in 
other 
fields. 


Third, 
the 
AIHLA 
could 
be 
implemented 
in 
other 
fields 
beyond 
healthcare. 
It 
would 
create 
several 
opportunities 
for 
researchers 
to 
explore 
the 
“AI 
as 
a 
learner” 
and 
“AI 
as 
a 
learning 
enhancer” 
also 
in 
other 
sectors. 


Finally, 
it 
is 
also 
possible 
to 
extend 
the 
research 
in 
the 
other 
two 
domains 
introduced 
by 
Bloom 
(1956), 
besides 
the 
cognitive 
one, 
namely, 
the 
affective 
domain 
and 
the 
psychomotor 
domain. 
First, 
the 
affective 
domain 
(Krathwohl 
et 
al. 
1973) 
includes 
the 
way 
we 
deal 
with 
things 
emotionally, 
such 
as 
feelings, 
values, 
appreciation, 
enthusiasms, 
motivations, 
and 
attitudes. 
Second, 
the 
psychomotor 
domain 
(Simpson 
1972) 
includes 
physical 
movement, 
coordination, 
and 
use 
of 
the 
motor-skill 
areas. 
Development 
of 
these 
skills 
requires 
practice 
and 
is 
measured 
in 
terms 
of 
speed, 
precision, 
distance, 
procedures, 
or 
techniques 
in 
execution.
