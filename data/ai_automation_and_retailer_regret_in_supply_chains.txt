Articial 
Intelligence 
(AI) 
has 
signicantly 
changed 
the 
supply 
chain 
process. 
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
study 
the 
eects 
associated 
with 
AI 
automation 
of 
the 
retailer's 
order 
decision 
in 
a 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
comprising 
one 
supplier 
and 
one 
regretful 
retailer. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
AI 
automation, 
the 
retailer 
has 
a 
regret 
bias 
in 
that 
it 
behaves 
as 
though 
considering 
the 
deviation 
between 
the 
realized 
demand 
and 
order 
quantity, 
when 
making 
an 
ex 
ante 
inventory 
decision. 
We 
nd 
that 
if 
prot 
margins 
of 
the 
supply 
chain 
are 
high, 
regret 
bias 
drives 
the 
retailer 
to 
decline 
the 
supplier's 
contract, 
whereas, 
if 
prot 
margins 
are 
low, 
regret 
drives 
retailers 
to 
order 
more 
from 
the 
supplier. 
As 
a 
result, 
although 
the 
automation 
of 
retailer 
decision 
leads 
to 
a 
higher 
expected 
prot 
for 
a 
retailer 
that 
operates 
in 
a 
centralized 
vacuum, 
it 
nevertheless 
can 
be 
a 
negative 
force 
for 
a 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
with 
either 
high 
or 
low 
prot 
margins. 
Perhaps 
more 
interestingly, 
as 
a 
retailer's 
decision 
becomes 
automatic, 
it 
is 
not 
destined 
to 
earn 
a 
higher 
expected 
prot. 
In 
the 
extreme, 
a 
lose-lose 
outcome 
can 
prevail 
in 
which 
automation 
potentially 
leaves 
both 
the 
retailer 
and 
supplier 
worse 
o.

Introduction 
Articial 
Intelligence 
(AI) 
automation 
is 
a 
key 
implication 
of 
the 
fourth 
industrial 
revolution, 
i.e., 
Industry 


4.0 
(Olsen 
and 
Tomlin 
2020). 
The 
potential 
payos 
of 
AI 
automation 
are 
enormous. 
Many 
rms 
have 
adopted 
1 


 


automated 
systems 
to 
manage 
inventory 
replenishment 
decisions. 
For 
example, 
automated 
inventory 
replenishment 
systems 
often 
recommends 
order 
quantities 
to 
the 
retail 
store 
managers 
(Van 
Donselaar 
et 
al. 
2010). 
Although 
this 
automated 
system 
eectively 
reduces 
decision 
bias 
of 
managers, 
interestingly, 
store 
managers 
might 
bypass 
the 
system, 
and 
manually 
decide 
orders 
(Fisher 
and 
Raman 
2010). 


In 
this 
paper, 
we 
analytically 
explore 
how 
AI 
automation|replacing 
human 
managers 
with 
an 
optimally 
programmed 
ordering 
system|aects 
ordering 
decisions 
and 
expected 
prots 
of 
newsvendors 
and 
suppliers 
in 
supply 
chains 
governed 
by 
wholesale 
price 
contracts. 
The 
question 
of 
how 
human 
managers 
decide 
orders 
has 
attracted 
signicant 
attention 
within 
operations 
management. 
The 
classical 
paper 
of 
Schweitzer 
and 
Cachon 
(2000) 
posits 
that 
newsvendors 
(retailers) 
attempt 
to 
minimize 
ex 
post 
regret, 
thus 
explaining 
the 
famous 
pull-to-center 
eect 
in 
newsvendor 
experiments. 
In 
essence, 
regret 
is 
a 
negative 
emotion 
experienced 
when 
an 
individual 
learns 
that 
an 
alternative 
course 
of 
action 
would 
have 
resulted 
in 
a 
more 
favorable 
outcome. 


We 
then 
develop 
a 
model 
that 
incorporates 
regret 
into 
the 
classical 
selling-to-newsvendor 
model. 
In 
our 
model, 
the 
supplier 
(he) 
leads 
by 
announcing 
a 
unit 
wholesale 
price 
to 
his 
newsvendor 
retailer 
(she), 
after 
which 
the 
newsvendor 
decides 
the 
quantity 
to 
purchase 
as 
stock 
at 
the 
start 
of 
her 
selling 
season. 
As 
a 
validation 
to 
the 
literature, 
we 
analytically 
show 
that 
in 
the 
single-newsvendor 
setting, 
the 
pull-to-center 
eect 
also 
exists. 
In 
addition, 
we 
show 
that 
the 
regret 
bias 
may 
drive 
a 
newsvendor 
to 
reject 
protable 
contracts 
oered 
by 
her 
supplier. 


Furthermore, 
we 
nd 
that, 
unlike 
in 
a 
single-newsvendor 
setting, 
regret 
bias 
in 
a 
selling-to-newsvendor 
setting 
can 
lead 
to 
increased 
expected 
prots 
for 
the 
system. 
This 
implies 
that 
automation 
can 
hurt 
the 
system, 
depending 
on 
the 
market 
situation. 
For 
example, 
we 
show 
that 
if 
prot 
margin 
of 
the 
supply 
chain 
(i.e., 
the 
dierence 
between 
the 
retail 
price 
and 
production 
cost) 
is 
relatively 
high, 
high 
levels 
of 
regret 
can 
benet 
the 
supply 
chain 
consisting 
of 
a 
biased 
newsvendor 
and 
a 
supplier. 
Intuitively, 
under 
this 
condition, 
regret 
can 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
bias 
that 
drives 
the 
newsvendor 
to 
decline 
the 
supplier's 
contract. 
To 
avoid 
this 
rejection, 
the 
supplier 
must 
charge 
a 
relatively 
low 
wholesale 
price, 
providing 
a 
counterbalance 
to 
decentralization's 
drive 
to 
charge 
a 
high 
wholesale 
price 
(Spengler 
1950). 
If 
prot 
margins 
are 
relatively 
low, 
regret 
bias 
can 
be 
a 
positive 
force 
for 
the 
supply 
chain, 
because 
under 
this 
condition, 
regret 
bias 
drives 
newsvendors 
to 
order 
more, 
providing 
a 
counterbalance 
to 
decentralization's 
drive 
to 
order 
less. 
Thus, 
in 
high 
and 
low 
margins, 
the 
net 
eect 
generates 
a 
potential 
to 
benet 
the 
supply 
chain 
as 
a 
whole. 


 


For 
more 
insights, 
we 
consider 
a 
baseline 
supply 
chain 
comprised 
of 
one 
newsvendor 
and 
one 
supplier, 
but 
managed 
by 
an 
unbiased 
central 
planner. 
In 
this 
setting, 
the 
supply 
chain 
as 
a 
whole 
would 
be 
worse 
o, 
if 
the 
unbiased 
central 
planner 
were 
replaced 
by 
a 
biased 
central 
planner; 
similarly, 
the 
supply 
chain 
would 
also 
be 
worse 
o, 
if 
no 
central 
planner 
were 
involved 
so 
that 
the 
two 
rms 
were 
optimize 
their 
individual 
prots. 
However, 
if 
the 
central 
planner 
were 
removed 
and 
the 
newsvendor 
were 
replaced 
with 
a 
biased 
newsvendor, 
depending 
on 
the 
extent 
of 
regret 
bias, 
the 
total 
expected 
prot 
of 
the 
channel 
could 
potentially 
equal 
that 
of 
the 
baseline 
channel. 
In 
this 
sense, 
regret 
bias 
could 
be 
a 
force 
that 
coordinates 
a 
decentralized 
channel 
with 
its 
centralized 
counterpart, 
particularly 
when 
the 
prot 
margin 
is 
relatively 
low. 


Given 
that 
both 
positive 
and 
negative 
interactive 
forces 
result 
from 
regret 
bias 
in 
a 
decentralized 
supply 
chain, 
we 
assess 
the 
eects 
of 
regret 
on 
the 
equilibrium 
outcomes 
of 
the 
supplier 
and 
the 
newsvendor. 
We 
nd 
that 
the 
expected 
prots 
of 
the 
supplier 
and 
the 
newsvendor 
can 
be 
characterized 
as 
a 
function 
that 
is 
not 
decreasing 
in 
the 
level 
of 
regret. 
This 
technical 
nding 
underpins 
two 
results. 
First, 
regret 
bias 
potentially 
benets 
the 
supplier 
when 
the 
prot 
margin 
of 
the 
supply 
chain 
is 
low. 
Under 
this 
condition, 
which, 
for 
example, 
would 
be 
the 
case 
for 
grocery 
goods, 
the 
retailer 
tends 
to 
under 
stock. 
In 
response 
to 
this 
tendency, 
if 
the 
level 
of 
regret 
increases, 
the 
newsvendor 
increases 
her 
order 
quantity, 
in 
turn 
positively 
aecting 
the 
supplier's 
prot, 
everything 
else 
being 
equal. 
Conversely, 
this 
means 
that 
the 
retailer's 
automation 
can 
harm 
the 
supplier. 
Second, 
the 
retailer's 
automation 
can 
even 
result 
in 
a 
self-harm. 
In 
particular, 
the 
regret 
bias 
of 
the 
newsvendor 
can 
boost 
her 
own 
performance, 
because 
the 
supplier 
may 
reduce 
his 
wholesale 
price 
when 
she 
becomes 
more 
biased 
via 
two 
dierent 
mechanisms. 
For 
the 
rst 
mechanism, 
the 
more 
biased 
newsvendor 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
reject 
the 
supplier's 
contract, 
squeezing 
the 
price 
range 
of 
the 
supplier, 
who 
is 
striving 
to 
secure 
the 
newsvendor's 
participation. 
In 
the 
second 
mechanism, 
even 
if 
the 
newsvendor's 
participation 
is 
secured, 
regret 
bias 
may 
cause 
her 
to 
choose 
an 
order 
quantity 
that 
is 
more 
sensitive 
to 
the 
wholesale 
price 
charged 
by 
the 
supplier. 
In 
this 
setting, 
as 
the 
newsvendor 
becomes 
more 
biased, 
the 
supplier 
has 
to 
oer 
a 
more 
favorable 
wholesale 
price, 
to 
encourage 
the 
newsvendor 
to 
order. 


The

2. 
Literature 
Review 
This 
paper 
contributes 
to 
the 
rich 
literature 
on 
regret 
bias. 
Bell 
(1982, 
1983) 
rst 
incorporates 
regret 
into 
the 
utility 
function 
and 
shows 
that 
it 
can 
explain 
certain 
well-known 
behavioral 
anomalies. 
Nasiry 
and 


¨ 


Popescu 
(2012) 
and 
Ozer 
and 
Zheng 
(2016) 
have 
recognized 
that 
regret 
can 
explain 
consumers’ 
purchase 
behavior. 
The 
literature 
has 
also 
recognized 
that 
regret 
can 
explain 
the 
manager's 
decision. 
Schweitzer 
and 
Cachon 
(2000) 
posit 
that 
newsvendors 
attempt 
to 
minimize 
regret 
in 
their 
order 
decisions, 
thereby 
explaining 
newsvendor 
behaviors. 
Li 
and 
Liu 
(2021) 
utilize 
regret 
to 
explain 
the 
seller's 
dynamic 
pricing 
behavior. 
We 
complement 
this 
literature 
by 
using 
regret 
to 
explain 
newsvendor's 
managerial 
decision 
in 
a 
supply 
chain 
setting. 
We 
accordingly 
investigate 
the 
theoretical 
impact 
of 
managerial 
regret 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
supply 
chain 
members 
and 
the 
value 
of 
order 
automation. 


There 
is 
also 
a 
rich 
literature 
that 
studies 
supply 
chains, 
where 
a 
retailer 
purchases 
the 
product 
from 
her 
supplier, 
then 
sells 
to 
consumers 
(Lariviere 
and 
Porteus 
2001, 
Cachon 
2003, 
Li 
and 
Petruzzi 
2017). 
This 
literature 
stream 
examines 
the 
eects 
of 
downstream 
retailer 
parameters, 
such 
as 
uncertainty 
or 
pricing 
power 
on 
the 
upstream 
supplier 
at 
equilibrium. 
This 
stream 
often 
models 
supply 
chains 
under 
the 
assumption 
that 
retailers 
are 
unbiased 
decision 
makers, 
which 
is 
not 
necessarily 
the 
case 
in 
practice 
according 
to 
the 
behavioral 
literature 
above. 
We 
extend 
this 
literature 
by 
incorporating 
regret 
as 
a 
cognitive 
bias 
to 
investigate 
its 
theoretical 
impact 
in 
a 
classical 
selling-to-newsvendor 
framework 
(Lariviere 
and 
Porteus 
2001). 
We 
thereby 
make 
four 
key 
contributions. 


First, 
we 
nd 
that 
regret 
is 
a 
cognitive 
bias 
that 
potentially 
benets 
supply 
chains 
that 
must 
distribute 
their 
products 
for 
their 
business 
in 
a 
decentralized 
manner, 
even 
though 
that 
bias 
would 
never 
benet 
the 
supply 
chains 
without 
a 
decentralized 
structure. 
Indeed, 
regret 
is 
a 
bias 
that 
could 
even 
coordinate 
a 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
with 
its 
system-wide 
rst-best 
benchmark. 
Second, 
we 
show 
that 
the 
regret 
bias 
of 
the 
newsvendor 
may 
benet 
her 
supplier: 
The 
newsvendor's 
regret 
can 
be 
taken 
advantage 
of 
by 
the 
supplier 
and 
eventually 
come 
across 
as 
a 
surplus 
of 
the 
supplier, 
depending 
on 
the 
prot 
margin 
of 
the 
supply 
chain 
and 
the 
bias 
level 
of 
the 
newsvendor. 
Third, 
contrary 
to 
the 
literature 
that 
suggests 
that 
retailer 
bias 
should 
result 
in 
self-harm 
(Li 
et 
al. 
2016, 
Li 
2019), 
we 
nd 
if 
the 
newsvendor 
forces 
her 
supplier 
to 
charge 
a 
lower 
wholesale 
price, 
and 
if 
the 
benet 
from 
such 
a 
reduced 
wholesale 
price 
outweighs 
the 
mismatch 
costs 


 


caused 
by 
regret 
bias, 
then 
overall 
regret 
bias 
would 
benet, 
rather 
than 
hurt 
the 
newsvendor, 
per 
se. 
Fourth, 
we 
illustrate 
that 
automation 
aiming 
to 
eliminate 
regret 
bias 
of 
the 
retailer 
can 
even 
result 
in 
a 
lose-lose 
situation 
for 
both 
the 
supplier 
and 
the 
retailer. 


Overall, 
this 
paper 
contributes 
to 
the 
general 
realm 
of 
AI, 
Industry 
4.0, 
or 
big 
data 
in 
operations 
management 
(Choi 
et 
al. 
2018, 
Kumar 
et 
al. 
2018, 
Cohen 
2018, 
Olsen 
and 
Tomlin 
2020). 
Since 
AI 
introduces 
an 
interaction 
between 
human 
and 
technology, 
this 
paper 
is 
particularly 
related 
to 
the 
human-machine 
interaction 
literature. 
For 
example, 
Dietvorst 
et 
al. 
(2015) 
nd 
that 
in 
general 
humans 
are 
averse 
to 
forecasts 
made 
by 
an 
algorithm, 
even 
when 
they 
outperform 
their 
less 
accurate 
human 
counterparts. 
Dietvorst 
et 
al. 
(2018) 
further 
nd 
that 
algorithmic 
aversion 
can 
be 
reduced 
when 
individuals 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
manipulate 
and 
make 
adjustments 
to 
the 
algorithm. 
Cui 
et 
al. 
(2021) 
have 
recently 
conducted 
eld 
experiments, 
and 
documented 
that 
the 
supplier 
factors 
in 
the 
retailers’ 
adoption 
of 
automation 
when 
making 
pricing 
decisions. 
Consequently, 
the 
supplier 
would 
charge 
dierent 
wholesale 
prices 
to 
retailers 
with 
dierent 
levels 
of 
automation. 
We 
follow 
suit 
to 
study 
the 
impact 
of 
retailer's 
adoption 
of 
automation 
and 
show 
that 
AI 
automation 
can 
lead 
to 
a 
better 
or 
worse 
performance 
for 
the 
decentralized 
supply 
chain. 


3. 
The 
Regretful 
Retailer 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
introduce 
regret 
to 
the 
classic 
newsvendor 
problem. 
In 
the 
algorithmic 
newsvendor 
problem, 
a 
decision 
maker 
decides 
an 
order 
quantity 
before 
observing 
the 
realization 
of 
random 
demand 
D. 
Given 
a 
unit 
cost 
c 
(≥ 
0) 
and 
a 
unit 
price 
p 
(≥ 
c), 
the 
order 
quantity 
q 
∗ 
that 
maximizes 
the 
expected 
prot 
pE[D 
∧ 
q] 
− 
cq, 
where 
E[] 
is 
the 
expectation 
operator 
and 
x 
∧ 
y 
= 
minfx, 
yg, 
is 
characterized 
by 
F 
(q 
)= 
, 
where 
F 
() 
is 
the 
distribution 
function 
of 
D 
and 
β 
≡ 
(p 
− 
c)=p 
is 
the 
critical 
fractile. 
Note 
that 
the 
critical 
fractile 
β 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
underage 
cost 
p 
􀀀c 
and 
p, 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
underage 
cost 
p 
􀀀c 
and 
overage 
cost 
c. 
Thus, 
an 
unbiased 
automatic 
order 
quantity 
is 
q 
∗ 
= 
F 
􀀀1(), 
and 
its 
correspondingly 
expected 
prot 
is 
∗ 
= 
pE[D 
∧ 
q 
] 
− 
cq 
∗ 
. 


Within 
this 
construct, 
a 
regretful 
newsvendor 
exhibits 
cognitive 
bias 
in 
caring 
\about 
reducing 
ex-post 
inventory 
error, 
the 
deviation 
between 
the 
order 
quantity 
and 
realized 
demand.” 
In 
essence, 
\[t]his 
preference 
could 
develop 
from 
the 
decision 
maker's 
anticipated 
regret 
or 
disappointment 
from 
not 
choosing 
the 
ex-post 
optimal 
order 
quantity 
(realized 
demand), 
even 
though 
that 
order 
quantity 
is 
rarely 
the 
ex-ante 
optimal 
order 
quantity” 
(Schweitzer 
and 
Cachon 
2000). 
Thus, 
the 
biased 
newsvendor 
places 
an 
order 
as 
though 
it 
maximizes 


pE[D 
∧ 
q] 
− 
cq 
− 

E[jq 
− 
Dj], 
(1) 


 


where 
γ 
≥ 
0, 
rather 
than 
the 
expected 
prot 
pE[D 
∧ 
q] 
− 
cq. 
In 
other 
words, 
a 
regretful 
newsvendor 
behaves 
as 
though 
it 
were 
maximizing 
(1) 
in 
lieu 
of 
maximizing 
pE[D 
∧ 
q] 
− 
cq. 
From 
the 
perspective 
of 
newsvendor 
tradeoff 
between 
underage 
and 
overage, 
regret 
causes 
an 
extra 
cognitive 
underage 
cost 
γ 
when 
the 
realized 
demand 
is 
higher 
than 
the 
order 
quantity 
(D>q) 
and 
an 
extra 
(and 
equal 
size 
of) 
cognitive 
overage 
cost 
γ 
when 
the 
realized 
demand 
is 
lower 
than 
the 
order 
quantity 
(D 
≤ 
q). 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
biased 
newsvendor 
behaves 
as 
though 
the 
underage 
cost 
is 
p 
− 
c 
+ 
γ 
(rather 
than 
p 
− 
c), 
whereas 
the 
overage 
cost 
is 
c 
+ 
γ 
(rather 
than 
c). 


In 
(1), 
the 
parameter 
γ 
is 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
missing 
demand 
induces 
regret, 
thus 
can 
be 
interpreted 
as 
the 
regret 
level. 
If 

> 
0, 
a 
newsvendor 
is 
subjected 
to 
the 
regret 
bias. 
The 
higher 
of 
the 
value 

, 
the 
more 
biased 
the 
newsvendor. 
Moreover, 
γ 
= 
0 
denotes 
a 
newsvendor 
that 
is 
not 
at 
all 
biased, 
and 
the 
newsvendor 
behaves 
as 
the 
classic 
newsvendor 
solution 
prescribes. 
To 
contrast 
against 
the 
regret 
bias 
we 
refer 
to 
a 
newsvendor 
dened 
by 
γ 
=0 
as 
an 
unbiased 
automatic 
newsvendor. 


The 
newsvendor's 
regret 
or 
disappointment 

jq 
− 
D| 
is 
dened 
as 
linear 
in 
the 
ex-post 
inventory 
error 
jq 
− 
D| 
to 
re
ex 
regret 
increases 
in 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
ex-post 
inventory 
error, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
regret 
when 
ex-post 
inventory 
error 
is 
absent 
(Schweitzer 
and 
Cachon 
2000). 
This 
particular 
linear 
function 
allows 
us 
to 
capture 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
newsvendor 
regret 
without 
obfuscating 
our 
theoretical 
analysis; 
it 
also 
has 
been 
analytically 
studied 
and 
empirically 
validated 
in 
dierent 
settings 
(Filiz-Ozbay 
and 
Ozbay 
2007, 
Engelbrecht-Wiggans 
and 
Katok 
2008). 
In 
the 
context 
of 
newsvendor 
experiments, 
Bostian 
et 
al. 
(2008) 
test 
dierent 
forms 
for 
the 
regret 
function 
and 
nd 
that 
the 
linear 
regret 
ts 
their 
experimental 
data. 
Particularly, 
after 
examining 
integer 
powers 
of 
the 
inventory 
error 
jq 
− 
D| 
from 
one 
to 
ve, 
they 
nd 
that 
the 
linear 
model 
in 
(1) 
performs 
better 
(or 
at 
least 
not 
worse) 
than 
models 
of 
higher 
powers.

Lemma 
1 
a) 
A 
newsvendor 
described 
by 
regret 
parameter 
γ 
orders 
a 
quantity 
q^(
) 
such 
that 
F 
(^q(
)) 
= 
(
), 
where 
^(
) 
≡ 
(p 
− 
c 
+ 

)=(p 
+2
). 
Hence, 
the 
order 
quantity 
increases 
in 

, 
i.e., 
q^0(
) 
> 
0 
if 
and 
only 
if 
< 
1=2. 


b) 
Accordingly, 
the 
newsvendor's 
expected 
prot 
^(
) 
is 
decreasing1 
in 
the 
regret 
parameter 

, 
i.e., 
^0(
) 
≤ 
0. 
Consequently, 
automation 
always 
improves 
the 
retailer's 
prot, 
i.e., 
^(
) 
≤ 
^(γ 
= 
0) 
= 
∗ 
. 
Lemma 
1a 
indicates 
that, 
as 
in 
the 
classical 
newsvendor 
problem, 
the 
biased 
newsvendor's 
optimal 
order 
quantity 
can 
also 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
underage 
and 
overage 
costs. 
That 
is, 
a 
biased 
newsvendor's 
optimal

In 
this 
paper, 
we 
use 
increasing 
and 
decreasing 
in 
a 
weakly 
sense. 


 


order 
quantity 
is 
characterized 
by 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
biased 
newsvendor's 
underage 
cost 
p 
􀀀c 
+ 
γ 
and 
p 
+2γ 
(the 
summation 
of 
biased 
underage 
cost 
p 
− 
c 
+ 
γ 
and 
biased 
overage 
cost 
c 
+ 

). 
To 
contrast 
against 
the 
regret 
bias, 
we 
therefore 
refer 
to 
β 
as 
unbiased 
fractile, 
while 
^(
) 
as 
biased 
fractile. 
In 
this 
perspective, 
the 
critical 
fractile 
caused 
by 
regret 
bias 
alone 
is 

+ 


γ 
=1=2, 
because 
by 
denition 
the 
regret 
causes 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
unit 
cognitive 
disutility 
(
) 
for 
overage 
and 
underage. 
The 
relationship 
between 
the 
critical 
fractile 
caused 
by 
regret 
bias 
(1/2) 
and 
the 
unbiased 
fractile 
β 
determines 
whether 
the 
biased 
newsvendor's 
order 
quantity 
is 
decreasing 
or 
increasing 
in 
the 
bias 
level 

. 
Consequently, 
regret 
bias 
creates 
a 
pull-to-center 
eect. 
In 
particular, 
if 
> 
1=2, 
then 
the 
critical 
fractile 
decreases 
as 
the 
regret 
bias 
becomes 
stronger, 
which 
leads 
to 
a 
smaller 
optimal 
ordering 
quantity; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
< 
1=2, 
a 
stronger 
regret 
bias 
will 
result 
in 
a 
larger 
optimal 
ordering 
quantity. 
This 
behavior 
implies 
that 
regret 
can 
result 
in 
either 
an 
increase 
or 
a 
decrease 
in 
a 
newsvendor's 
service 
level, 
as 
dened 
by 
the 
no-stockout 
probability 
F 
(^q(
)). 
In 
particular, 
if 
< 
1=2, 
then 
the 
service 
level 
increases 
with 
respect 
to 

; 
if 
> 
1=2, 
then 
the 
service 
level 
decreases 
with 
respect 
to 

. 
Note 
that 
this 
comparison 
between 
the 
regret 
induced 
fractile 
1/2 
and 
the 
unbiased 
fractile 
β 
is 
useful 
for 
the 
forthcoming 
results. 


Moreover, 
Lemma 
1b 
indicates 
that 
a 
newsvendor's 
expected 
prot 
decreases 
in 
its 
regret 
parameter 

. 
Thus, 
regret 
is 
a 
bias 
that 
hurts 
the 
newsvendor, 
and 
the 
larger 
the 
bias, 
the 
larger 
the 
hit 
to 
the 
newsvendor's 
bottom 
line. 
AI 
automation 
can 
largely 
remove 
the 
human 
involvement 
in 
the 
decision 
process 
to 
reduce 
the 
impact 
of 
behavioral 
bias. 
Therefore, 
automation 
always 
benets 
the 
newsvendor. 
We 
next 
show 
that 
automation 
can 
be 
a 
negative 
force 
in 
a 
decentralized 
supply 
chain. 


4. 
Regret 
in 
a 
Supply 
Chain 
We 
introduce 
our 
notion 
of 
selling-to-newsvendor 
pioneered 
by 
Lariviere 
and 
Porteus 
(2001). 
Consider 
a 
supply 
chain 
in 
which 
a 
supplier 
manufactures 
a 
single 
product 
that 
it 
sells 
to 
a 
newsvendor 
retailer 
that 
sells 
it 
to 
end 
consumers 
during 
a 
single 
period. 
The 
supplier 
produces 
the 
product 
at 
a 
unit 
production 
cost 
c 
and 
the 
retailer 
sells 
the 
product 
at 
a 
unit 
retail 
price 
p. 
The 
supplier 
rst 
decides 
the 
unit 
wholesale 
price 
w 
it 
charges 
the 
retailer, 
whereas, 
for 
a 
given 
wholesale 
price 
w, 
the 
newsvendor 
retailer 
makes 
her 
order 
decision 
q 
to 
maximize 
her 
prot 
pE[q 
∧ 
D] 
− 
wq. 
A 
key 
observation 
for 
this 
setting 
is 
that 
the 
newsvendor 
accepts 
the 
supplier's 
contract 
if 
and 
only 
if 
w 
≤ 
p, 
where 
accepting 
the 
contract 
is 
protable 




for 
the 
newsvendor. 
Moreover, 
the 
order 
quantity 
is 
q 
= 
F 
􀀀1(w=p), 
where 
F 
()=1 
− 
F 
(). 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
imputed 
prot 
of 
the 
supplier 
is 
(w 
− 
c)q 
=(w 
− 
c)F􀀀1(w=p). 
Because 
there 
is 
a 
one-to-one 
mapping 


 


􀀀



from 
w 
∈ 
[c, 
p] 
to 
q 
∈ 
[0;F 
􀀀1(c=p)], 
the 
supplier's 
problem 
reduces 
to 
supq2[0;F􀀀1(c=p)] 
pF 
(q) 
− 
cq. 
From 
this 


perspective, 
q 
is 
a 
proxy 
for 
the 
supplier's 
wholesale 
price 
decision. 
Given 
this, 
the 
equilibrium 
order 
quantity 
is 
unique 
when 
F 
() 
is 
IGFR 
(Increasing 
Generalized 
Failure 
Rate), 
i.e., 
the 
generalized 
failure 
rate 
of 
D, 
gD(x) 
:= 
xf(x)=F(x), 
is 
an 
increasing 
function, 
where 
f() 
is 
the 
density 
function 
of 
D. 
We 
thus 
assume 
that 
D 
is 
IGFR, 
which 
includes 
many 
commonly 
applied 
demand 
distributions, 
such 
as 
normal, 
lognormal, 
uniform, 
exponential, 
Weibull, 
gamma, 
and 
power. 
In 
summary, 
in 
this 
classical 
setting, 
the 
newsvendor 
always 
accepts 
the 
supplier's 
wholesale 
price 
contract 
as 
long 
as 
the 
wholesale 
price 
is 
less 
than 
the 
retail 
price. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
supplier 
always 
has 
feasible 
wholesale 
prices 
to 
ensure 
a 
non-negative 
prot. 


We 
now 
incorporate 
the 
notion 
of 
regret 
bias 
(§3) 
into 
this 
classical 
selling-to-newsvendor 
model. 
Recall 
that 
regret 
is 
a 
cognitive 
bias 
in 
which 
the 
newsvendor 
behaves 
as 
though 
considering 
ex 
post 
inventory 
regret. 
Thus, 
the 
retailer's 
newsvendor 
problem 
boils 
down 
to 
the 
equivalent 
of 
(1) 
except 
with 
w 
in 
place 
of 
c. 
Consequently, 
the 
supplier's 
problem 
is 


sup 
(w 
− 
c)q 
(OBJ) 
wc 
s.t. 
q 
= 
arg 
max 
q 
pE[D 
∧ 
q] 
− 
wq 
− 

E[jq 
− 
Dj] 
(IC) 
(2) 
pE[D 
∧ 
q] 
− 
wq 
− 

E[jq 
− 
Dj] 
≥ 
0. 
(IR) 


The 
rst 
constraint 
(IC) 
in 
(2) 
ensures 
that 
the 
newsvendor 
behaves 
as 
though 
to 
optimally 
choose 
an 
order 
quantity 
q. 
The 
second 
constraint 
(IR) 
above 
ensures 
that 
the 
newsvendor 
accepts 
the 
contract 
because, 
by 
doing 
so, 
she 
behaves 
as 
though 
earning 
no 
less 
than 
her 
reservation 
which, 
without 
loss 
of 
generality, 
is 
normalized 
to 
zero. 
For 
the 
objective 
function 
(OBJ) 
in 
(2), 
we 
note 
that 
the 
supplier, 
unlike 
the 
newsvendor, 
has 
no 
regret 
bias 
because 
the 
supplier 
does 
not 
hold 
inventory 
and 
has 
no 
ex-post 
inventory 
error. 
Also, 
Katok 
and 
Wu 
(2009) 
nd 
that 
when 
human 
suppliers 
in 
a 
wholesale 
contract 
are 
matched 
with 
human 
newsvendors 
placing 
orders, 
suppliers 
quickly 
learn 
to 
set 
wholesale 
prices 
optimally. 
Thus, 
in 
(2), 
the 
supplier 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
sophisticated 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
he 
is 
not 
only 
a 
prot-maximizer 
but 
also 
can 
foresee 
the 
newsvendor's 
regret 
bias. 


Given 
(2), 
Lemma 
2 
characterizes 
the 
newsvendor's 
order 
decision 
when 
the 
supplier 
oers 
her 
a 
wholesale 
price 
w. 


Lemma 
2 
(newsvendor 
response) 
Dene 
w(
) 
≡ 
F(q(
))(p 
+2
) 
− 

, 
where 
q(
) 
is 
the 
unique 
solution 


R 


of 
0 
q(
) 
xf(x)dx 
= 

=(p 
+2
) 
for 
µ 
= 
E[D]. 


 


a) 
If 
the 
supplier's 
wholesale 
price 
contract 
is 
such 
that 
w 
≤ 
w(
), 
then 
the 
order 
quantity 
of 
the 
newsvendor 
F􀀀1( 
w+

with 
regret 
parameter 
γ 
is 
q^d(
, 
w)= 
p+2γ 
). 
Moreover, 
the 
order 
quantity 
decreases 
in 
the 
wholesale 
price: 


@q^d(
, 
w)1 


= 
− 
< 
0. 
(3)

@w 
(p 
+2
)f(^qd(
)) 


However, 
when 
w>w(
), 
the 
newsvendor 
rejects 
the 
supplier's 
contract. 


b) 
The 
above 
w(
) 
satises 
w(
) 
≤ 
p. 
Moreover, 
w(
) 
decreases 
in 
the 
regret 
parameter 

, 
i.e., 
w0(
) 
≤ 
0. 
Lemma 
2a 
shows 
that, 
as 
in 
the 
classic 
selling-to-newsvendor 
setting, 
there 
also 
exists 
a 
threshold 
value 
of 
wholesale 
price 
w(
) 
above 
which 
the 
newsvendor 
declines 
the 
contract 
of 
the 
supplier. 
In 
particular, 
if 
the 
supplier 
oers 
a 
contract 
with 
a 
relatively 
generous 
wholesale 
price 
(w 
≤ 
w(
)), 
the 
newsvendor 
accepts 
the 


qd(
;w)

contract 
and 
places 
a 
positive 
order 
quantity. 
Moreover, 
in 
(3), 
∂ 
ˆ 
@w 
< 
0 
means 
that 
the 
newsvendor 
orders 
less 
as 
the 
wholesale 
price 
goes 
higher. 
The 
magnitude 
of 
decreasing 
order 
due 
to 
the 
increasing 
wholesale 


qd(
;w) 
qd(
;w)

price, 
i.e., 
j∂ 
ˆ 
j, 
depends 
on 

. 
As 
an 
example, 
for 
the 
uniform 
demand 
with 
a 
constant 
f(), 
j∂ 
ˆ 
j

@w 
@w 


always 
decreases 
in 

. 
That 
is, 
as 
the 
newsvendor 
becomes 
more 
biased, 
her 
order 
quantity 
becomes 
less 
sensitive 
to 
the 
wholesale 
price. 
However, 
if 
the 
wholesale 
price 
is 
relatively 
high 
(w>w(
)), 
the 
newsvendor 
declines 
the 
supplier's 
contract 
and 
does 
not 
order 
at 
all. 


Lemma 
2b 
further 
shows 
that 
w(
) 
is 
less 
than 
p 
which 
is 
the 
unbaised 
newsvendor's 
threshold 
value, 
i.e., 
w(
) 
≤ 
p. 
This 
means 
that 
even 
if 
the 
supplier 
charges 
an 
acceptable 
wholesale 
price 
(for 
the 
unbiased 
newsvendor), 
the 
biased 
newsvendor 
may 
not 
order 
if 
w>w(
). 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
biased 
newsvendor 
considering 
the 
ex-post 
inventory 
error 
may 
not 
order 
even 
if 
doing 
so 
is 
protable. 
This 
is 
indeed 
the 
case 
in 
laboratory 
studies 
simulating 
the 
newsvendor 
decision 
in 
Lariviere 
and 
Porteus's 
(2001) 
setting. 
For 
example, 
in 
their 
controlled 
laboratory 
experiment 
where 
the 
newsvendors 
have 
the 
option 
to 
reject 
the 
contracts 
from 
their 
suppliers, 
Davis 
et 
al. 
(2014) 
nd 
that 
newsvendors 
reject 
signicantly 
more 
than 
the 
theory 
predicted 
and 
even 
do 
not 
accept 
contracts 
which 
are 
protable 
for 
the 
unbiased 
newsvendor. 
Actually, 
Lemma 
2b 
also 
indicates 
that 
the 
threshold 
value 
w(
) 
decreases 
in 
the 
regret 
level, 
meaning 
that 
the 
more 
biased 
newsvendor 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
reject 
the 
supplier's 
contract, 
everything 
else 
being 
equal.

only 
when 
the

small 
(γ

because 
if 
the 
newsvendor's 
bias

higher 
than

the 
newsvendor 
never 
accepts 
the 
supplier's 
contract 
regardless 
of 
his 
decision 
for 
wholesale 
price. 
This 
is 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
traditional 
selling-tonewsvendor 
model, 
where 
recall 
that 
feasible 
wholesale 
price

always 
exist.

be 
reformulated 
as

in

We 
next 
solve 
(4) 
and 
explore 
the 
results 
and 
implications 
for 
the 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
in 
the 
following 
sections. 


5. 
The 
Supply 
Chain 
Prot 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
study 
the 
solution 
to 
(4) 
to 
assess 
the 
overall 
impact 
of 
regret 
bias 
in 
the 
decentralized 
supply 
chain. 
We 
characterize 
the 
equilibrium 
outcomes 
as 
functions 
of 
the 
regret 
level 
by 
establishing 
that 
the 
supplier's 
optimal 
proxy 
q 
exists 
and 
is 
unique 
for 
any 
given 
regret 
level 

. 
Then, 
given 
those 
equilibrium 
outcomes, 
we 
illustrate 
that 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
centralized 
analog 
in 
§3 
the 
total 
expected 
prot 
for 
the 
decentralized 
system, 
as 
a 
whole, 
is 
not 
necessarily 
monotone 
decreasing 
in 

. 


We 
begin 
by 
characterizing 
the 
optimal 
solution 
to 
(4) 
for 
any 
given 
regret 
parameter 

. 


Proposition 
1 
(equilibrium 
order) 
For 
any 
given 
regret 
parameter 

, 
the 
optimal 
solution 
to 
(4) 
exists 


q^d(
)= 


8
⎨ 
⎩ 


and 
is 
unique. 
In 
particular, 
the 
optimal 
solution 
is 


q(
), 
if 
^(
) 
≤ 
G(q(
)) 
(Binding 
Equilibrium: 
BE) 


G􀀀1(^(
)), 
if 
^(
) 
>G(q(
)) 
(Non-Binding 
Equilibrium: 
NBE), 


(5) 


where 
G(q) 
≡ 
F 
(q)+ 
qf(q). 


Notice 
from 
Proposition 
1 
that, 
like 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
centralized 
setting, 
the 
order 
quantity 
in 
the 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
also 
depends 
on 
the 
biased 
fractile 
^(
). 
Specically, 
Proposition 
1 
indicates 
that 
if 
the 
biased 
system 
fractile 
is 
relatively 
low 
such 
that 
^(
) 
≤ 
G(q(
)), 
then 
q^d(
)= 
q(
). 
In 
such 
a 
case, 
the 
supplier 
oers 
the 
wholesale 
price 
w(
) 
so 
that 
the 
biased 
newsvendor 
considering 
ex-post 
inventory 
error 
accepts 
the 
contract 
oered 
by 
the 
supplier 
but 
anticipates 
the 
minimal 
surplus. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
supplier 
will 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
set 
his 
wholesale 
price 
to 
the 
point 
where 
the 
newsvendor 
would 
not 
accept 
the 
contract 
for 
a 
higher 
wholesale 
price. 
This 
equilibrium 
where 
the 
(IR) 
constraint 
in 
(2) 
is 
binding, 
we 
term 
binding 
equilibrium 
(BE). 


^

However, 
if 
the 
biased 
system 
fractile 
is 
relatively 
high 
such 
that 
(
) 
>G(q(
)), 
the 
(IR) 
constraint 
in 
(2) 
is 
not 
binding, 
i.e., 
the 
automatic 
newsvendor 
anticipates 
to 
earn 
more 
than 
the 
minimal 
surplus. 


 


We 
term 
this 
equilibrium 
non-binding 
equilibrium 
(NBE). 
Note 
that, 
for 
the 
automatic 
newsvendor 
where 
q(γ 
= 
0) 
= 
0, 
^(γ 
= 
0) 
= 
>G(q(γ 
= 
0)) 
= 
0 
always 
holds. 
That 
is, 
NBE 
is 
the 
only 
equilibrium 
type 
for 
the 
supply 
chain 
with 
an 
automatic 
newsvendor; 
it 
is 
the 
newsvendor's 
bias 
leading 
to 
a 
new 
equilibrium 
type, 
namely 
BE. 
In 
fact, 
as 
the 
newsvendor 
becomes 
more 
biased 
(i.e., 
the 
regret 
parameter 
γ 
increases), 
it 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
the 
BE. 


Proposition 
2 
(order 
quantity 
and 
regret) 
a) 
The 
equilibrium 
order 
q^d(
) 
in 
NBE 
increases 
in 
the 
regret 
parameter 

, 
i.e., 
q^d 
0 
(
) 
≥ 
0, 
if 
and 
only 
if 
β 
≤ 
1=2. 


b) 
However, 
q^d 
0 
(
) 
≥ 
0 
always 
holds 
in 
BE. 
Proposition 
2a 
shows 
that, 
in 
NBE, 
the 
impact 
of 
regret 
bias 
in 
the 
decentralized 
setting 
is 
similar 
to 
its 
impact 
in 
the 
centralized 
setting 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
the 
distortion 
from 
regret 
is 
such 
that 
the 
equilibrium 
order 
quantity 
increases 
(resp. 
decreases) 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
regret 
parameter 
if 
and 
only 
if 
the 
supply 
chain's 
unbiased 
fractile 
β 
is 
lower 
(resp. 
higher) 
than 
the 
regret 
fractile 
1=2. 
In 
a 
decentralized 
setting, 
the 
pull-to-center 
eect 
can 
prevail 
as 
in 
the 
centralized 
setting. 


Proposition 
2b 
shows 
that 
in 
BE 
the 
equilibrium 
order 
quantity 
always 
increases 
in 
the 
regret 
bias 
γ 
regardless 
of 
the 
value 
of 
prot 
margins. 
Intuitively, 
under 
the 
case 
of 
BE, 
the 
newsvendor 
achieves 
the 
minimal 
surplus, 
and 
she 
serves 
only 
as 
a 
distributor 
for 
the 
supplier's 
product. 
Under 
this 
case, 
when 
the 
newsvendor 
becomes 
more 
biased, 
her 
expected 
utility 
decreases, 
and 
the 
supplier 
has 
to 
reduce 
the 
wholesale 
price 
to 
secure 
the 
newsvendor's 
participation. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
newsvendor 
orders 
more 
as 
she 
becomes 
more 
regretful. 


Although 
Proposition 
2a 
is 
qualitatively 
similar 
to 
Lemma 
1a 
in 
that 
it 
characterizes 
a 
behavioral 
pull-tocenter 
eect 
arising 
from 
regret 
bias, 
the 
implication 
of 
decision 
bias 
in 
a 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
can 
be 
dierent 
from 
the 
centralized 
system. 
In 
particular, 
we 
note 
that 
when 
the 
newsvendor 
anticipates 
a 
surplus 
higher 
than 
the 
minimal 
surplus, 
q^d(
) 
increases 
in 
γ 
when 
β 
≤ 
1=2. 
This 
means 
that, 
ceteris 
paribus,a 
biased 
newsvendor 
is 
more 
prone 
to 
overorder 
than 
if 
it 
were 
unbiased. 
This 
becomes 
more 
evident 
for 
the 
BE 
case 
in 
Proposition 
2b, 
where 
the 
newsvendor 
anticipates 
the 
minimal 
surplus. 
For 
such 
a 
case, 
regret 
bias 
always 
leads 
to 
a 
larger 
order 
quantity. 
This 
is 
interesting 
because 
supply 
chain 
decentralization 
is 
a 
force 
that 
drives 
the 
newsvendor 
to 
order 
less; 
while 
regret, 
a 
cognitive 
bias, 
serves 
as 
a 
counter 
force. 


To 
develop 
insight 
into 
the 
net 
eect 
of 
these 
two 
forces, 
we 
investigate 
the 
impact 
of 
regret 
bias 
on 
the 
expected 
prot 
of 
the 
supply 
chain: 


T 
(
) 
≡ 
pE[D 
∧ 
q^d(
)] 
− 
cq^d(
). 
(6) 


 


Recall 
from 
Lemma 
1 
that 
regret 
is 
a 
bias 
that 
necessarily 
robs 
from 
a 
newsvendor's 
bottom 
line 
in 
a 
centralized 
setting. 
As 
Proposition 
3 
illustrates 
this 
may 
not 
be 
true 
in 
the 
analog 
setting 
in 
which 
the 
newsvendor 
purchases 
from 
her 
supplier. 


Proposition 
3 
(supply 
chain 
prot) 
Suppose 
> 
1=2. 
The 
supply 
chain's 
expected 
prot 
T 
(
) 
is 
decreasing 
in 
γ 
in 
NBE. 
However, 
T 
(
) 
is 
increasing 
in 
γ 
in 
BE. 


Proposition 
3 
illustrates 
that 
the 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
may 
benet 
from 
the 
newsvendor's 
regret 
bias. 
For 
a 
relatively 
high 
unbiased 
fractile 
(> 
1=2), 
although 
NBE 
is 
sucient 
to 
guarantee 
that 
regret 
will 
translate 
into 
a 
lower 
total 
expected 
prot 
for 
the 
decentralized 
supply 
chain, 
just 
as 
it 
does 
for 
the 
centralized 
supply 
chain, 
that 
guarantee 
is 
lost 
for 
the 
case 
of 
BE. 


For 
insights, 
consider 
the 
following 
hypothetical 
construct. 
Suppose 
an 
unbiased 
central 
planner 
aims 
to 
determine 
the 
rst-best 
order 
quantities 
to 
maximize 
the 
total 
expected 
prots 
of 
the 
the 
supplier 
and 
the 
newsvendor. 
The 
expected 
prot 
of 
such 
a 
system 
is 
pE[D 
∧ 
q] 
− 
cq. 
Therefore, 
the 
rst-best 
order 
quantity 
is 
dened 
by 
F 
(q 
)= 
. 
The 
performance 
of 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
depends 
on 
the 
relationship 
between 
their 
order 
quantities 
q^d(
) 
and 
the 
system-wide 
rst-best 
order 
quantity 
q 
∗ 
. 
The 
closer 
q^d(
) 
to 
q 
∗ 
, 
the 
better 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
decentralized 
supply 
chain. 
Thus, 
we 
plot 
these 
two 
quantities 
and 
the 
equilibrium 
prot 
as 
functions 
of 
in 
γ 
using 
a 
uniform 
demand 
in 
Figure 
1. 
In 
this 
gure, 
the 
equilibrium 
is 
binding 
(resp. 
non-binding) 
when 
regret 
level 
is 
relatively 
high 
(resp. 
low); 
see 
Appendix 
for 
details. 
By 
Figure 
1, 
it 
can 
be 
clearly 
seen 
that 
when 
β 
≤ 
1=2, 
the 
supply 
chain 
prot 
can 
decrease 
or 
increase 
in 
the 
level 
of 
regret.

would

were 
extremely

(γ

Lemma 
4 
a) 
An 
(unbiased) 
centralized 
planner 
orders 
more 
than 
the 
unbiased 
decentralized 
supply 
chain. 
That 
is, 
q

= 
0). 


b) 
Suppose 
γ 
=

An 
(unbiased) 
centralized 
planner 
orders 
less 
than 
the 
(biased) 
decentralized 
system 
if 
β 
≤ 
1=2 
but 
orders 
more 
than 
the 
(biased) 
decentralized 
system 
if 
> 
1=2. 
That 
is, 
q 
∗ 
<q^d(γ 
= 

) 
(⇒ 
β 
≤ 
1=2. 
Lemma 
4a 
essentially 
means 
that 
the 
unbiased 
newsvendor 
in 
a 
decentralized 
setting 
underorders 
compared 
to 
its 
centralized 
analog. 
This 
specic 
distinction 
between 
a 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
and 
a 
centralized 
chain 
results 
in 
double 
marginalization, 
which 
is 
a 
manifestation 
of 
the 
independent 
objectives 
of 
the 
two 
rms 
within 
a 
decentralized 
chain 
and 
ultimately 
leads 
to 
a 
reduced 
level 
of 
production 
for 
the 
decentralized 
chain 
compared 
to 
its 
centralized 
analog, 
everything 
else 
being 
equal. 
Furthermore, 
Lemma 
4b 
shows 
that 
the 
extremely 
biased 
newsvendor 
with 
a 
regret 
level 

¯ 
in 
a 
decentralized 
setting 
may 
underorder 
or 
overorder 
compared 
to 
its 
centralized 
analog, 
depending 
on 
the 
value 
of 
(unbiased) 
fractile 
. 
Perhaps 
the 
biased 
newsvendor 
in 
the 
decentralized 
system 
can 
order 
more 
than 
the 
unbiased 
newsvendor 
in 
the 
centralized 
system, 
particularly 
when 
β 
≤ 
1=2. 


This 
possibility 
begs 
the 
question 
whether 
regret 
bias 
could 
extract 
a 
balanced 
(i.e., 
symmetric) 
distortion 
of 
both 
the 
overage 
and 
underage 
costs 
that 
the 
central 
planner 
assesses 
so 
that 
the 
equilibrium 
order 
quantity 
corresponds 
to 
the 
rst-best 
order 
decision.

investigates 
this 
possibility.

Proposition 
4 
shows 
that 
regret 
bias 
can 
induce 
system 
coordination 
under 
the 
right 
conditions. 
If 
the 
prot 
margin 
is 
relatively 
low 
(β 
≤ 
1=2), 
then 
there 
exists 
a 
level 
of 
regret 
at 
which 
the 
newsvendor 
would 
converge 
on 
the 
system-wide 
coordinating 
order 
quantities. 
Regret 
is 
a 
bias 
that 
potentially 
osets 
the 
eect 
of 
decentralization 
so 
that 
a 
system 
actually 
is 
equivalent 
to 
its 
centralized 
benchmark. 


Given 
the 
inherent 
trade-os 
exemplied 
by 
Propositions 
3-4, 
we 
dive 
deeper 
into 
the 
interplay 
between 
the 
supplier 
and 
the 
newsvendor 
retailer 
to 
ascertain 
who 
wins 
and 
who 
loses 
from 
regret 
bias 
in 
the 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
by 
studying 
how 
regret 
aects 
each 
player 
separately 
in 
equilibrium. 


 


6. 
The 
Supplier 
Prot 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
examine 
the 
impact 
of 
regret 
bias 
on 
the 
supplier's 
expected 
prot 
S 
(
). 
To 
that 
end, 
we 
establish 
Proposition 
5 
to 
characterize 
how 
the 
equilibrium 
wholesale 
price 
w^d(
) 
behaves 
as 
a 
function 
of 
the 
regret 
bias. 


Proposition 
5 
(wholesale 
price) 
a) 
In 
BE, 
the 
equilibrium 
wholesale 
price 
w^d(
) 
always 
decreases 
in 

, 
i.e., 
w^d 
0 
(
) 
≤ 
0. 


b) 
However, 
in 
NBE, 
w^d(
) 
increases 
in 
γ 
when 
the 
biased 
fractile 
is 
relatively 
low, 
i.e., 
w^d 
0 
(
) 
≥ 
0 
when 
^(
) 
B, 
where 
B≡ 
1=2+ 
F 
􀀀1(1=2)f(F 
􀀀1(1=2)). 
Proposition 
5 
shows 
that 
the 
equilibrium 
wholesale 
price 
decreases 
or 
increases 
in 
the 
level 
of 
the 
regret 
bias 
depending 
on 
the 
case 
of 
the 
equilibrium. 
For 
the 
case 
of 
BE, 
the 
supplier 
sets 
a 
wholesale 
price 
to 
secure 
the 
newsvendor's 
participation. 
As 
the 
newsvendor 
becomes 
more 
biased, 
securing 
the 
newsvendor's 
participation 
becomes 
more 
challenging 
for 
the 
supplier, 
and 
his 
wholesale 
price 
becomes 
more 
lenient. 
For 
the 
NBE 
case, 
the 
supplier 
may 
raise 
his 
wholesale 
price 
as 
the 
newsvendor 
becomes 
more 
biased, 
because 
the 
newsvendor's 
order 
becomes 
less 
sensitive 
to 
the 
wholesale 
price 
as 
the 
newsvendor 
becomes 
more 
biased 
(Lemma 
2). 
Consequently, 
the 
supplier's 
pricing 
power 
is 
enhanced. 
This 
is 
true 
especially 
when 
the 
biased 
fractile 
is 
relatively 
low, 
where 
the 
order 
quantity 
is 
already 
relatively 
low 
(Lemma 
1). 
As 
an 
illustration, 
consider 
the 
setting 
with 
a 
uniform 
demand 
D 
∼ 
U[0, 
100], 
where 
B 
= 
1. 
For 
this 
setting, 
^(
) 
< 
B 
always 
holds. 
Then, 
w^d(
) 
always 
increases 
in 
γ 
for 
the 
NBE 
case. 
The 
increasing 
pricing 
power 
can 
enhance 
the 
supplier's 
performance 
as 
shown 
in 
Proposition 
6. 


Proposition 
6 
(supplier 
prot) 
a) 
For 
the 
NBE 
case, 
the 
supplier's 
prot 
S 
(
) 
increases 
in 

, 
i.e., 
S 
0 
(
) 
≥ 
0 
if 
and 
only 
if 
^(
) 
B, 
where 
B 
is 
dened 
in 
Proposition 
5. 


R 
F 
􀀀1(1=2) 
R 
F 
􀀀1(1=2) 


b) 
For 
the 
BE 
case, 
S 
0 
(
) 
≥ 
0 
when 

< 
L, 
where 
L≡ 
p 
0 
xf(x)dx/ 
µ 
− 
2 
0 
xf(x)dx 
. 
The 
qualitative 
impact 
of 
regret 
on 
the 
supplier's 
equilibrium 
prot 
boils 
down 
to 
an 
unambiguous, 
but 
equilibrium-specic 
test. 
If 
the 
equilibrium 
is 
non-binding, 
as 
in 
Proposition 
6a, 
then 
the 
supplier 
suers 
from 
regret 
if 
the 
biased 
fractile 
is 
relatively 
high 
(^(
) 
> 
B). 
In 
such 
a 
case, 
the 
qualitative 
eect 
on 
the 
supplier 
in 
the 
supply 
chain 
is 
analogous 
to 
that 
on 
the 
central 
planner, 
albeit 
for 
a 
dierent 
reason: 
whereas 
regret 
translates 
into 
decreased 
operational 
eciency 
for 
the 
central 
planner, 
regret, 
in 
this 
case, 
translates 
into 
decreased 
order 
quantity 
from 
the 
retailer. 
If 
the 
system-biased 
fractile 
is 
relatively 
high, 
the 
newsvendor 
retailer 
in 
the 
decentralized 
system 
confronts 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
her 
safety 
stock 
should 
be 
positive 
(Lemma 


 


1). 
Correspondingly, 
in 
such 
a 
situation 
if 
the 
retailer 
is 
biased, 
her 
order 
quantity 
will 
tend 
to 
decrease, 
which 
would 
negatively 
aect 
the 
supplier's 
prot, 
everything 
else 
being 
equal. 
Rather, 
in 
NBE 
case, 
if 
^(
) 
> 
B 
is 
not 
true, 
the 
supplier 
would 
not 
necessarily 
suer 
from 
selling 
to 
a 
biased 
newsvendor. 
Intuitively, 
regret 
in 
this 
case 
translates 
into 
increased 
pricing 
power 
that 
the 
supplier 
can 
leverage 
to 
his 
advantage 
in 
the 
supply 
chain. 


Perhaps 
of 
more 
interest, 
Proposition 
6b 
indicates 
that 
the 
supplier 
can 
also 
benet 
from 
regret 
in 
the 
BE 
case, 
where 
regret 
always 
results 
in 
a 
lower 
wholesale 
price 
(Proposition 
5a). 
Intuitively, 
when 
the 
regret 
level 
of 
the 
newsvendor 
is 
relatively 
low, 
she 
stocks 
relatively 
low 
in 
the 
BE 
case. 
Thus, 
the 
newsvendor 
would 
stock 
more 
as 
she 
becomes 
more 
biased 
(Proposition 
2b), 
beneting 
the 
supplier. 
As 
an 
illustration 
of 
Proposition 
6, 
consider 
again 
the 
setting 
of 
D 
∼ 
U[0, 
100]. 
For 
this 
particular 
example, 
where 
B 
= 
1 
and 
L 
= 
p=2, 
the 
supplier 
benets 
from 
regret 
bias 
in 
the 
NBE 
case 
because 
^(
) 
< 
B. 
Similarly, 
the 
supplier 
would 
also 
benet 
from 
regret 
in 
the 
BE 
case 
because 

< 
L 
always 
holds 
(see 
Appendix). 


7. 
The 
Newsvendor 
Prot 
Next 
we 
examine 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
regret 
bias 
on 
the 
newsvendor 
retailer's 
expected 
prot: 


R(
)= 
pE[D 
∧ 
q^d(
)] 
− 
w^d(
)^qd(
) 


= 
pE[D 
∧ 
q^d(
)] 
− 
[(p 
+2
)F(^qd(
)) 
− 

]^qd(
) 


Z 
q^d(
) 


= 
p 
xf(x)dx 
+ 

q^d(
)[1 
− 
2F(^qd(
))]. 
(8) 


0 


Given 
(8), 
it 
is 
not 
immediately 
obvious 
how 
changes 
in 
γ 
aect 
R(
) 
because 
there 
are 
two 
drivers 
at 
play. 
One 
driver 
is 
the 
direct 
eect 
of 
γ 
on 
the 
retailer's 
equilibrium 
expected 
prot 
for 
a 
given 
wholesale 
price. 
The 
direct 
eect 
of 
regret 
bias 
is 
a 
negative 
force 
on 
the 
retailer's 
prot 
because 
the 
retailer 
makes 
a 
non-optimal 
ordering 
decision, 
everything 
else 
being 
equal. 
The 
second 
driver 
is 
an 
indirect 
eect 
of 

: 
the 
supplier 
may 
charge 
a 
dierent 
wholesale 
price 
when 
the 
level 
of 
newsvendor 
regret 
changes. 
The 
nal 
impact 
of 
regret 
bias 
depends 
on 
the 
relative 
magnitudes 
of 
these 
two 
forces. 
Ultimately, 
the 
functional 
outcome 
of 
that 
trade-off 
is 
distribution 
dependent 
and 
complicated, 
but 
Proposition 
7 
provides 
one 
useful 
suciency 
test 
for 
assessing 
the 
impact 
of 
regret 
on 
R(
). 


Proposition 
7 
(newsvendor 
prot) 
a) 
In 
the 
BE 
case, 
the 
newsvendor's 
prot 
R(
) 
increases 
in 

, 
i.e., 
R 
0 
(
) 
≥ 
0 
if 

> 
L, 
where 
L 
is 
dened 
in 
Proposition 
6. 


b) 
In 
the 
NBE 
case, 
there 
always 
exist 
~(≥ 
0) 
and 

~(≥ 
0) 
such 
that 
the 
newsvendor's 
prot 
R(
) 
increases 
in 
γ 
over 
a 
region 
of 
γ 
∈ 
[0;
~] 
when 
>˜ 
. 
 


Proposition 
7 
shows 
that, 
given 
the 
existence 
of 
distributions 
that 
meet 
the 
Proposition 
7 
test, 
the 
newsvendor 
benets 
from 
her 
own 
decision 
bias 
in 
a 
decentralized 
supply 
chain, 
although 
she 
is 
always 
hurt 
from 
the 
bias 
in 
the 
centralized 
system 
(Lemma 
1). 
Intuitively 
speaking, 
as 
the 
newsvendor 
becomes 
more 
biased, 
although 
she 
is 
worse 
off 
for 
a 
given 
wholesale 
price, 
the 
supplier 
may 
charge 
a 
lower 
wholesale 
price. 
If 
the 
benet 
from 
the 
reduced 
wholesale 
price 
outweighs 
the 
loss 
due 
to 
regret 
bias, 
regret 
as 
a 
cognitive 
bias 
may 
benet 
the 
newsvendor 
altogether. 
This 
happens 
either 
in 
the 
BE 
case, 
when 
the 
newsvendor 
bias 
is 
relatively 
high 
(
> 
L), 
or 
in 
the 
NBE 
case, 
when 
the 
decision 
bias 
is 
relatively 
low 
(
<
~). 
In 
BE, 
for 
a 
relatively 
high 
regret 
bias 
(
> 
L), 
the 
newsvendor 
is 
in 
a 
position 
with 
a 
relatively 
high 
order 
quantity 
(Proposition 
2a). 
Consequently, 
a 
reduced 
wholesale 
price 
due 
to 
regret 
bias 
(Proposition 
5a) 
adds 
a 
signicant 
prot 
to 
the 
newsvendor. 
In 
the 
NBE 
case, 
the 
wholesale 
price 
is 
not 
necessarily 
decreasing 
as 
the 
newsvendor 
becomes 
more 
biased 
according 
to 
Proposition 
5. 
Thus, 
the 
newsvendor 
bias 
results 
in 
self-benet 
when 
the 
operational 
loss 
due 
to 
regret 
is 
relatively 
low, 
which 
occurs 
where 
the 
regret 
bias 
is 
relatively 
low. 


Although 
Proposition 
7 
provides 
a 
useful 
logical 
taxonomy 
of 
the 
potential 
eects 
resulting 
from 
newsvendor 
bias 
on 
her 
own 
prot, 
the 
concern 
of 
applicability 
of 
Proposition 
7 
remains. 
To 
address 
this 
concern 
we 
consider 
a 
power 
distribution, 
a 
more 
generalized 
distribution 
than 
uniform. 


Example 
1 
Consider 
a 
power 
distribution, 
i.e., 
f(x)= 
kxk􀀀1 
, 
where 
k 
≥ 
0 
for 
x 
∈ 
[0, 
1]. 
Then, 

¯ 
is 
such 
that 



)1+k

(p􀀀c+¯ 
=(p+2
)
k 
. 
Furthermore, 
the 
equilibrium 
is 
binding 
when 
(p􀀀c+
)1+k 
≤ 
(p+2
)
k(1+k)1+k; 
otherwise, 
the 
equilibrium 
is 
non-binding. 
Moreover, 
for 
this 
particular 
demand, 
L 
= 
p=(21+1=k 
− 
2) 
and 
B 
= 
(1+ 
k)=2. 


To 
illustrate 
Example 
1, 
consider 
an 
instance 
of 
k 
=0:4, 
p 
= 
1 
and 
c 
=0:1. 
This 
is 
a 
case 
of 
high 
prot 

)1+k

margin, 
which 
can 
be 
true 
for 
the 
products 
such 
as 
information 
goods. 
Then, 
(p 
− 
c 
+¯ 
=(p 
+ 
2
)
k 
(⇒ 

=0:58 
and 
(p 
− 
c 
+ 

)1+k 
≤ 
(p 
+2
)
k(1 
+ 
k)1+k 
(⇒ 
γ 
≥ 
0:19. 
Example 
1 
therefore 
implies 
that 
the 
equilibrium 
is 
non-binding 
when 
γ 
is 
relatively 
low 
(
< 
0:19), 
whereas, 
the 
equilibrium 
is 
binding 
when 
γ 
is 
relatively 
high 
(0:19 
≤ 
γ 
≤ 
0:58). 
In 
the 
BE 
case, 
Proposition 
7a 
implies 
that 
R 
0 
(
) 
≥ 
0 
always 
holds 
for 
this 
example 
because 
L 
=0:1 
< 
0:19. 
In 
the 
NBE 
case, 
Proposition 
7b 
indicates 
that 
newsvendor 
regret 
can 
result 
in 
a 
self 
benecial 
situation 
because 
^(
) 
< 
B 
(⇒ 

< 
0:5 
always 
holds, 
where 
B 
=0:7, 
and 

< 
0:19 
in 
NBE. 
Overall, 
this 
example 
illustrates 
that 
regret 
bias 
of 
the 
newsvendor 
can 
boost 
her 
self 
performance 
in 
both 
the 
case 
of 
BE 
and 
the 
case 
of 
NBE. 


 


8. 
Who 
Loses 
and 
Who 
Wins 
from 
Automation? 
To 
synthesize 
the 
results 
of 
§§6-7, 
we 
characterize 
and 
classify 
the 
interplay 
between 
the 
supplier 
and 
the 
retailer 
by 
summarizing 
who 
wins 
and 
who 
loses 
(and 
when) 
from 
automation 
aiming 
to 
eliminate 
regret 
bias 
in 
the 
decentralized 
supply 
chain. 
Given 
the 
observations 
from 
§4 
on 
the 
decentralized 
supply 
chain 
overall, 
we 
are 
particularly 
interested 
in 
identifying 
circumstances 
when 
a 
win-win 
outcome 
is 
possible 
and, 
somewhat 
more 
perversely, 
whether 
or 
not 
circumstances 
exist 
when 
a 
lose-lose 
outcome 
would 
prevail. 
Based 
on 
the 
results 
characterized 
by 
Propositions 
6{7, 
then, 
there 
are, 
in 
principle, 
four 
possible 
macro-level 
outcomes 
(lose-lose, 
lose-win, 
win-lose, 
and 
win-win 
for 
the 
supplier 
and 
the 
newsvendor, 
respectively), 
depending 
on 
the 
shapes 
of 
S 
(
) 
and 
R(
) 
as 
a 
function 
of 

. 
We 
illustrate 
these 
outcomes 
by 
specifying 
a 
power 
demand 
distribution. 


If 
a 
given 
power 
distribution 
and 
system 
fractile 
are 
such 
that 
S 
(
) 
is 
monotone 
(decreasing) 
in 
γ 
while 
R(
) 
is 
non-monotone 
(decreasing-increasing) 
in 

, 
automation 
would 
result 
in 
either 
a 
win-win 
situation 
that 
both 
rms 
benets 
from 
automation, 
or 
in 
a 
win-lose 
situation 
in 
that 
the 
supplier 
benets 
from 
the 
retailer's 
automation, 
but 
she 
does 
so 
at 
the 
retailer's 
expense. 
As 
Figure 
2 
alludes, 
the 
case 
of 
a 
power 
distribution, 
used 
to 
illustrate 
Example 
1, 
denes 
one 
example 
in 
which 
these 
possible 
outcomes 
prevail. 
In 
particular, 
automation 
can 
result 
in 
a 
win-win 
(win-lose) 
situation 
when 
regret 
bias 
is 
relatively 
low 
(high). 
In 
this 
case, 
if 
the 
newsvendor's 
regret 
level 
is 
already 
low 
(
< 
0:245), 
both 
rms 
benet 
from 
automation; 
however, 
if 
the 
regret 
level 
is 
comparatively 
higher, 
the 
supplier 
benets 
from 
automation 
but 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
retailer. 


If 
the 
power 
distribution 
and 
system 
fractile 
are 
such 
that 
both 
S 
(
) 
and 
R(
) 
are 
non-monotone 
as 
in 
Figure 
3, 
then 
a 
lose-lose 
situation 
is 
also 
possible. 
In 
particular, 
in 
this 
case, 
if 
the 
regret 
level 
is 
relatively 
moderate 
(0:065 
<
< 
0:19), 
both 
the 
retailer 
and 
the 
supplier 
ironically 
end 
up 
worse 
off 
as 
a 
result 
of 
automation. 
We 
attribute 
this 
overall 
shrinking 
pie 
to 
the 
increased 
deleterious 
system-wide 
eects 
stemming 
from 
the 
double 
marginzation 
eects. 
This 
reduction 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
supplier's 
exertion 
of 
his 
increased 
monopoly 
pricing 
power 
in 
response 
to 
the 
newsvendor's 
automation. 
The 
end 
result 
in 
this 
case 
is 
akin 
to 
a 
lose-lose 
outcome.

Concluding 
Remarks 
In 
this 
paper 
we 
investigate 
the 
implications 
and 
applications 
of 
ordering 
automation 
in 
a 
supply 
chain. 
In 
a 
classical 
selling-to-newsvendor 
framework, 
we 
characterize 
the 
supplier's 
and 
the 
newsvendor's 
optimal

decisions 
in 
equilibrium, 
and 
show 
that 
their 
expected 
prots 
in 
equilibrium 
can 
decrease 
or 
increase 
with 
the 
level 
of 
regret, 
depending 
on 
the 
specic 
demand 
distribution 
and 
the 
value 
of 
the 
system-wide 
critical 
fractile. 
We 
nd 
that 
ordering 
automation 
potentially 
can 
be 
a 
negative 
force 
in 
a 
decentralized 
supply 
chain. 
In 
showing 
these 
results, 
we 
nd 
that 
two 
dierent 
types 
of 
equilibria 
exist, 
namely 
the 
binding 


 


equilibrium 
and 
the 
non-binding 
equilibrium, 
where 
automation 
can 
be 
self-harmful. 
We 
attribute 
these 
results 
to 
the 
interplay 
of 
competing 
forces 
by 
which 
human 
behavior 
(particularly, 
regret) 
yields 
a 
biased 
decision 
that 
disfavors 
the 
newsvendor, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
but 
provides 
a 
decreased 
wholesale 
price 
that 
favors 
the 
newsvendor, 
on 
the 
other. 


From 
an 
operations 
perspective, 
AI 
introduces 
an 
interaction 
between 
humans 
and 
technology, 
and 
would 
have 
a 
signicant 
impact 
on 
operations 
and 
supply 
chain 
processes. 
Our 
result 
implies 
that 
automation 
aiming 
to 
eliminate 
regret 
can 
actually 
hurt, 
rather 
than 
benet 
each 
supply 
chain 
member 
depending 
on 
the 
retailer's 
existing 
regret 
level. 
In 
the 
most 
perverse 
of 
these 
potential 
situations, 
a 
lose-lose 
outcome 
prevails 
in 
which 
automation 
can 
potentially 
leave 
both 
the 
retailer 
and 
supplier 
worse 
off 
in 
equilibrium. 


Our 
results 
may 
have 
value 
for 
rms 
adopting 
AI 
automation 
tied 
to 
reducing 
retailer's 
order 
bias. 
Since 
AI 
automation 
presumably 
can 
be 
initiated 
by 
suppliers 
or 
by 
newsvendors, 
our 
results 
suggest 
the 
following 
strategic 
considerations 
for 
settings 
characterized 
by 
uncoordinated 
or 
unilateral 
bias 
AI 
automation 
opportunities. 
If 
regret 
bias 
is 
low 
(high), 
the 
supplier 
(newsvendor) 
should 
resist 
relinquishing 
unilateral 
control 
of 
AI 
automation 
eorts 
to 
the 
newsvendor 
(supplier); 
but, 
if 
regret 
bias 
is 
moderate, 
the 
supplier 
(retailer) 
should 
help 
facilitate 
retailer-led 
(supplier-led) 
AI 
automation 
initiatives. 


In 
this 
paper, 
we 
model 
the 
adoption 
of 
AI 
as 
a 
removal 
of 
the 
retailer's 
decision 
bias. 
Clearly, 
there 
are 
many 
other 
factors 
to 
be 
considered 
for 
adopting 
AI. 
For 
example, 
the 
benets 
of 
AI 
include 
reducing 
labor 
cost 
and 
improving 
eciency 
whereas 
the 
drawbacks 
of 
AI 
include 
lack 
of 

exibility 
and 
potential 
ethical 
issues. 
The 
retailer 
should 
consider 
all 
these 
potential 
benets 
and 
drawbacks 
when 
deciding 
whether 
to 
implement 
it. 
As 
AI 
becomes 
more 
advanced 
and 
smarter, 
the 
trade-off 
also 
becomes 
more 
challenging.
