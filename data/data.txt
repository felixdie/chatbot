Voice-based AI in Call Center Customer Service:
A Natural Field Experiment
Abstract
Voice-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been recently deployed to replace traditional
interactive voice response (IVR) systems in call center customer service. However, there is little
evidence that sheds light on how the implementation of AI systems impacts customer behavior, as well
as AI systems’ effects on call center customer service performance. By leveraging the proprietary data
obtained from a natural field experiment in a large telecommunication company, we examine how the
introduction of a voice-based AI system affects call length, customers’ demand for human service, and
customer complaints in call center customer service. We find that the implementation of the AI system
temporarily increases the duration of machine service and customers’ demand for human service;
however, it persistently reduces customer complaints. Furthermore, our results reveal interesting
heterogeneity in the effectiveness of the voice-based AI system. For relatively simple service requests,
the AI system reduces customer complaints for both experienced and inexperienced customers.
However, for complex requests, customers appear to learn from the prior experience of interacting with
the AI system, which leads to fewer complaints. Moreover, the AI-based system has a significantly
larger effect on reducing customer complaints for older and female customers as well as for customers
who have had extensive experience using the IVR system. Finally, we find that the speech-recognition
failures in customer-AI interactions lead to increases in customers’ demand for human service and
customer complaints. The results from this study provide implications for the implementation of an AI
system in call center operations.

1. Introduction
Advances in machine learning (ML) technology have accelerated the application of voice-based
artificial intelligence (AI) systems in various business functions, performing tasks such as speech
recognition and natural language processing.1 With the intention of improving customer experience as
well as reducing service costs, an increasing number of companies are deploying voice-based AI to
complement or replace current systems and services provided by human agents (Xiao and Kumar
2021). According to Markets and Markets (2021), the global conversational AI market size is predicted
to grow from $6.8 billion in 2021 to $18.4 billion by 2026, and AI-supported customer service is a
major factor driving the growth. Moreover, the value of global call center AI market reached 959.80
million in 2020 and is predicted to reach $ 9,949.61 Million by 2030 (Valuates Reports 2022).
Our study examines the implementation of a voice-based AI system that replaces the traditional
interactive voice response (IVR) system in a customer service call center. In the absence of the AI
system, customer calls are first connected to the IVR system and customers communicate with the IVR
system through phone keypads to obtain specific services. The service requests that the IVR system
cannot handle are then transferred to human agents. Upon the rollout of a voice-based AI system,
customers communicate with the AI in natural dialogues, and the AI system performs tasks, such as
processing natural language in a manner that resembles human intelligence. Note that the voice-based
AI system is different from the traditional IVR system in several ways, as summarized in Table 1. To
begin with, the AI system continuously evolves with the accumulation of a large amount of service data,
enhancement in computing power, and improvement in learning algorithms (LeCun et al. 2015). In
contrast, the IVR system was designed by industry experts based on their service experiences, does not
change with service data, and requires customers to strictly follow pre-set rules when interacting with
the system (Resnick and Virzi 1995). Through speech recognition in the AI system, customers can tell
the system which kinds of services they require; on this basis, they are directly routed to certain services
(Tang et al. 2003). In contrast, the IVR system typically relies on a hierarchical structure that directs
customers in a step-by-step manner to locate specific services (Suhm et al. 2002). To switch services,
customers are required to return to the main service menu and repeat the above-mentioned actions to
select another service.

Considering the technological advantages of the voice-based AI system, the implementation of
such a system as a replacement for the traditional IVR system might significantly influence customer
service experiences. First, the AI system improves the flexibility of service flows and enables
personalized customer service. Instead of strictly following pre-defined service flows like in the IVR
system, customers can actively control the pace of service when they interact with an AI-based system.
For example, because of the AI system’s flexible navigation structure, customers can skip over the
layers of IVR structures and directly access the desired services. Second, the voice-based AI system can
adapt to customers’ interaction preferences to improve their service experiences. While the IVR system
provides highly structured and limited choices for customers, the AI system can interact with customers
in natural dialogues, allowing customers to express their needs adequately (Fountain et al. 2019).
Moreover, the voice-based AI system has the ability to learn from prior interactions with the input data
from customers and iteratively improve its performance. In scenarios wherein the AI system gets stuck,
it can tag the problems with the help of human agents and learn from the scenarios to resolve similar
problems in the future (Wilson and Daugherty 2018).
According to Forbes Insights, call centers are predicted to be the new sandbox for AI-powered
customer experience, as they are expected to deploy AI-based tools to boost retention, loyalty, and
profit.2 AI technology has gained widespread adoption in call center services over the past few years.3
Nonetheless, despite the growing interests in AI, its implementation has a
proof-of-concept-to-production gap (Perry 2021). In other words, AI can work well theoretically or on
test data, but it may fail to reach expectations in practical settings. In our study context, an IVR system
operates with pre-designed fixed logic, while an AI-based system relies on a complex algorithmic
structure. In turn, given the high variability of customer interactions in call center service, the service
efficacy of an AI system is likely to be subject to variation (Brynjolfsson and Mcafee 2017). For
example, customers may speak with accents or dialects while communicating with AI, thereby resulting
in speech-recognition failures that influence the effectiveness of the systems. However, without the
rigid logic of an IVR system, an AI-based system might learn to adapt to the customer interactions and
even be more effective than an IVR system. The high variability of tasks within customer service
requires more flexible, human-like responses, and the AI system may work better than the strictly
programmed IVR systems that are inflexible. Therefore, we believe it is important for researchers to
empirically test the effectiveness of AI in real-life settings.
Most prior studies on AI in operation management (OM) have mainly focused on the effects of
AI-supported automation and smartness, and examine how related technologies are deployed to
facilitate operation decisions or redesign operation process in product pricing (Karlinsky-Shichor and
Netzer 2019), order decision-making (Li and Li 2022), and quality management (Senoner et al. 2021).
Limited work explores the role of AI in interactions between customers and service systems,
particularly in service contact design scenarios (Roth and Mentor 2003). With few exceptions, for
example, Cui et al. (2021) examined the role of AI in buyer price requests and its influence on seller
price quotations in business-to-business (B2B) wholesaling. Contributing to this knowledge gap in
prior literature, our study focuses on the effects of implementing a voice-based AI system in the
business-to-consumer (B2C) customer service setting. Specifically, analyzing data from a natural field
experiment in a large telecommunication company’s customer service call center, we seek to answer the
following research questions:
How does the introduction of voice-based AI systems impact call length, customer’s
demand for human service, and customer complaints in call center customer services? How do the
effects of AI implementation in customer service vary for different customers?
To this end, we examine a natural field experiment4 with a voice-based AI system implemented
in a telecommunication company’s call center customer service operation. In the experiment, the
company’s customer service operation rolls out the AI system to replace the IVR system in different
phases, serving a portion of its customers based on the last digit of the customer’s phone number,
4 A natural field experiment (NFE) is the type of experiment ―where the environment is one where the subjects naturally
undertake these tasks and where the subjects do not know that they are participants in an experiment. Such an exercise
represents an approach that combines the most attractive elements of the lab and naturally-occurring data: randomization and
realism. (List 2007)
thereby allowing them to engage in customer service calls through natural dialogues with AI. We then
use difference-in-differences (DID) estimations to identify the effects of the AI-based system on key
outcomes. Our results reveal that the duration of machine service and customers’ demand for human
service increases temporarily after the introduction of the voice-based AI system, suggesting a possible
novelty effect. Meanwhile, the AI system significantly and persistently reduces customer complaints.
Moreover, we find interesting heterogeneity in the main effects of the AI system. To begin
with, the effects of the AI system on customer complaints appear to depend on the complexity of the
service requests. Compared with the customers who continue to use the traditional IVR system, the
customers assigned to use the AI-based system tend to make fewer complaints when they have
relatively simple service requests. In contrast, with relatively complex service requests (i.e., service
calls transferred to human agents), customers learn from their prior interactions with AI; this learning
effect leads to fewer complaints. Lastly, we find that the AI-based system exerts a significantly greater
effect on reducing customer complaints for older customers, female customers, and for customers with
longer user tenure.
Our study makes several important contributions to the related literature on AI applications and
call center operations. First, our study adds to research on AI applications by extending the scope to the
call center customer service setting and offers useful insights into how AI-powered service flexibility
impacts different outcomes in human-AI interactions (Luo et al. 2019, Sun et al. 2019, Cui et al. 2021).
Second, we contribute to the literature on call center customer service operations by empirically
examining how the implementation of the AI system affects customer behavior and the performance of
customer service, responding to calls for research on using disruptive technologies like AI to address
OM problems in general (Kumar et al. 2018, Karlinsky-Shichor and Netzer 2019) and to explore the
direct effects of technology-mediated customer-involved service contact designs in particular (Roth and
Menor 2003). In addition, building on related OM literature on call center operations, which views
customers as mostly homogenous and uses a single metric to represent the performance of operation
systems for all customers (Khudyakov et al. 2010, Tezcan and Behzad 2012), our study further explores
customer heterogeneity in responding to the operations of the voice-based AI system.
Furthermore, our findings also offer useful implications for practice. We demonstrate that using
the voice-based AI system to replace the IVR system does not result in customer aversion to the AI
system, thereby validating the effectiveness of using voice-based AI systems in call center customer
service. We also demonstrate the novelty effect of implementing an AI system and find significant
heterogeneity in the effectiveness of voice-based AI systems on reducing customer complaints based on
the complexity of customer requests as well as customers’ age, gender, and tenure with the company
service, respectively. These results provide actionable insights into the implementation and further
development of voice-based AI systems. For example, companies must consider the possible short-term
increases in the duration of machine service and customers’ demand for human service while
scheduling for a service system that applies voice-based AI to replace the IVR system. Instead of
relying on customers’ self-learning, companies could educate their customers on using an AI system
with relatively complex requests. Moreover, the details obtained from customer-AI conversations
reveal that speech-recognition failures may lead to negative consequences. Therefore, it is necessary for
companies to continuously improve the capability of their AI systems to cater to a diverse customer
base.
2. Related Literature
2.1. Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Systems
Following prior literature, we define AI systems as algorithms that perform perceptual, cognitive, and
conversational functions typical of the human mind (Longoni et al. 2019). In recent years, the
significant development of AI systems has led to wide adoptions and applications in various domains.
Specifically, in the OM literature (see the summary of related literature in E-Companion A), from the
technical perspective, some prior work attempted to design AI-based algorithms to solve operational
problems such as demand or sales forecasting (Cui et al. 2018), product pricing (Yang et al. 2022), and
quality inferring (Senoner et al. 2021). Meanwhile, scholars have also explored how AI-enabled
automation and smartness features facilitate or support operational decisions in contexts such as price
request (Cui et al. 2021), order decision-making (Li and Li 2022), and automated pricing
(Karlinsky-Shichor and Netzer 2019).
Recently, a few studies on the application of AI systems have begun to understand the use of
such systems in commerce operations, where the AI system directly interact with individuals. For
example, Cui et al. (2021) examined how AI chatbots affect suppliers’ price quoting strategies. They
found that automation of chatbots alone leads to discrimination against chatbot buyers, but signaling the
use of a smart recommendation enabled by an AI system effectively reduces suppliers’ price quote for
chatbot buyers. In addition, Sun et al. (2019) suggested that the use of voice-based AI in online
shopping significantly affects consumers’ search behavior and purchase decisions. These prior studies
primarily focused on the role of AI systems in facilitating sales, but not much is known regarding the
application of voice-based AI systems in post-sales—that is, the scenario of customer service. In this
regard, our study aims at addressing this research void in the stream of work on AI system applications
by empirically examining the impact of implementing a voice-based AI system as a replacement for an
IVR system for customer service on the key outcomes related to customer experience and call center
operations.
2.2. Information Technology and Service Operation
Information technology plays an important role in improving service operations (Roth and Menor
2003). Companies increasingly rely on technology-based services to reduce service costs (Krishnan et
al. 1999) and increase service efficiency (Beckman and Sinha 2005). In recent years, with the
accumulation of large amounts of data on customers and transactions, companies have gradually
applied data-driven algorithms to automatically process service-related tasks—such as customer
segmentation, pattern identification, service instruction, and real-time personalization—which, in turn,
help companies to improve service quality (Sodhi et al. 2022, Sun et al. 2022).
Customers play an essential role in the delivery of services (Roth and Menor 2003). The design
of customer contact—the interaction between a customer and a service provider—is important for
shaping customers’ service experiences (Kellogg and Chase 1995). Prior research has empirically
examined the contact between customers and employees (Kellogg and Chase 1995, Soteriou and Chase
1998) and demonstrated that the physical service environment significantly influences customers’
perceptions and behavior (Bitner 1992). However, the advancement of information technology is
changing the ways in which customers interface with service providers. For example, companies
commonly establish self-service systems to cater to customers’ real-time service needs (Tezcan and
Behzad 2012). More recently, AI is being implemented to replace or complement conventional service
providers (Xiao and Kumar 2021). Froehle and Roth (2004) extended the customer contact perspective
to technology-mediated services and called for research on exploring the effects of virtual service
contact designs. Therefore, this paper focuses on the effects of different virtual service contact designs
(i.e., IVR and AI systems) in the context of call center customer service and specifically investigates
how replacing IVR systems with voice-based AI directly influences customers’ interaction outcomes.
2.3. Information Technology and Call Center Customer Service
Call center customer service has been an essential channel through which customers interact with firms
(Aksin et al. 2007, Tezcan and Behzad 2012). New developments in information technology provide an
opportunity to redesign and improve service-delivery operations in call centers. For example,
information technology supports a call center to expand to a larger scale (Adria and Chowdhury 2004).
In such contexts, researchers have examined the effects of call center centralization (Adria and
Chowdhury 2004) and discussed the risks caused by large-scale service systems (Pang and Whitt 2009).
Meanwhile, capacity management translates into a complex process in modern call centers. Researchers
have thus investigated the impacts of flexible labor resources (Kesavan et al. 2014) and attempted to
develop real-time schedule adjustment frameworks (Mehrotra et al. 2010). Another prevalent
technology-enabled change in call center operation is outsourcing; a wealth of research has explored
issues related to outsourcing (Kocaga et al. 2015) and call-routing (Gans and Zhou 2007) strategies in
such contexts. In the above studies, researchers have mainly focused on optimizing system designs in
contexts where technologies have been deployed to facilitate service operations (e.g., Aksin et al.
2007). However, little research has explored the effects of different technology-mediated contact
designs with customers directly involved in service delivery (Roth and Mentor 2003).
Specifically, in call center customer service, one typical technology-mediated service contact
design is the IVR system, which enables self-service at the front end of phone calls (Tezcan and Behzad
2012). Well-implemented IVR systems have the potential to automate a significant portion of services
and lead to improved customer service experiences (Tezcan and Behzad 2012). Thus, ample prior work
has examined the design of IVR-equipped service systems (Khudyakov et al. 2010, Suhm and Peterson
2002). Meanwhile, related studies from the user’s perspective reveal that customers often feel
when they interact with an IVR system because they perceive the services provided by IVR systems
be less customized and report that such systems occasionally do not understand their needs (Dean
2008). Consequently, customers often attempt to avoid IVR systems due to the lack of personalized
services or social interactions; instead, they seek direct interaction with human agents (Tezcan and
Behzad 2012).
Recent developments in AI technologies have enabled its applications in various contexts
(Brynjolfsson et al. 2019, Cui et al. 2021, Sodhi et al. 2022). For example, in 2017, Google’s machine
learning algorithms achieved a 95% accuracy rate for speech recognition in the English language, a
level that is close to actual human dialogue.5 In the customer service setting, voice-based AI systems
can understand customer needs through their voice inputs and can interact with customers in a
human-like manner (Van Doorn et al. 2017, Wilson and Daugherty 2018, Xiao and Kumar 2021).
However, considering the complexity of AI technology, it is challenging to determine the
effectiveness of AI systems in a real-world setting that goes beyond training data (Brynjolfsson and
Mcafee 2017). Once an AI system is deployed, it is expected to handle a large variety of situations
that may be unforeseen in training data. For example, customers may speak with accents or dialects
while communicating with AI, thereby resulting in speech-recognition failures that influence the
effectiveness of systems. Therefore, how AI implementation affects customer behaviors and the
performance of customer services remains an important empirical question that warrants further
investigation.
3. The Effects of the Implementation of AI on Call Center Customer Service
Based on the above discussions, in this section, we seek to discuss a few predictions on how the
implementation of a voice-based AI system in call center customer service will affect three key
metrics that are of interest to OM researchers: call length, demand for human service, and customer
complaints. While we do not provide any directional hypotheses in this section, the discussion serves
as a theoretical basis that guides our empirical analyses, which we report in subsequent sections.
5 Google’s ability to understand natural language is almost equivalent to that of humans.
Call length. Call length represents the duration of a customer’s service call (Gans et al. 2003),
which is important in the management of call center customer service operations because it directly
impacts scheduling and routing designs (Gans et al. 2003). In a traditional IVR system, the services
are organized in a tree-like hierarchical structure, whereby the leaves represent different services, the
nodes indicate customer states in the system, and the connections among different nodes indicate the
paths to specific services. All paths are pre-designed and customers can move only from one node to
another by inputting information in accordance with the guidance of the system. Typically, customers
must pass through several nodes before reaching certain services. Meanwhile, they must pay attention
to obtaining information on how to move from one node to another. An IVR system design typically
entails a time-consuming service experience. In contrast, with an AI-based service system, customers
can skip all the layers of IVR structures and directly access intended services by briefly summarizing
their needs to the system, which is likely to result in shorter call lengths, compared to a traditional
IVR system.
Conversely, it is also possible that an AI system leads to an increase in call lengths, as
compared to IVR systems, due to the characteristics of the speech-based interaction mode. To begin
with, when using the AI system, customers need to take time to summarize their needs in the form of
dialogues for the AI system to predict the intended services. Second, according to prior research on
communication modes, individuals interacting with text-based service systems (e.g., by inputting
numbers in the IVR systems) follow the cognitive economy principle, such that they are more likely
to focus on service requests and use keyword commands to improve communication efficiency (Le
Bigot et al. 2007). In contrast, the speech-based interaction mode enhances users’ involvement; users
tend to use quest-irrelevant expressions, such as politeness expressions in their interactions (Chafe
1982, Le Bigot et al. 2007), which could make information exchanges less effective (Le Bigot et al.
2007). In addition, when in conversational mode with an AI, users are expected to adapt their
behavior to the interaction system (Le Bigot et al. 2007, Cowan et al. 2015). Consequently, users
might devote more time and cognitive effort to formulate their speech and repeat information heard
during the interactions in order to share a common lexicon and syntactic structure with the interaction
system (Le Bigot et al. 2007). Therefore, speech-based AI service interactions may have longer
service durations than services handled by an IVR system. Based on the above discussions, it is
challenging to clearly predict the direction as well as the magnitude of changes in call length after the
introduction of the voice-based AI system; thus, the effect of the voice-based AI system (vs. IVR
system) remains an open question that warrants further empirical investigation.
Demand for human service. Customers’ demand for human service has direct implications
for staffing problems and operational costs within call center customer service (Tezcan and Behzad
2012). The introduction of AI may have mixed effects on customers’ demand for human service. On
the one hand, prior studies on AI applications demonstrate that, in certain contexts, individuals have a
subjective perception against AI and, thus, might be reluctant to interact with it even though AI now
offers high-level performance (Dietvorst et al. 2015; Longoni et al. 2019; Luo et al. 2019). When the
AI system offers the flexibility of transferring to human agents, customers may skip interacting with
AI and turn directly to human agents. Therefore, the AI-based system may increase customers’
demand for human service.
On the other hand, previous research also suggests that providing individuals with even a
slight amount of control over the AI’s behavior has the potential to mitigate their aversion to it
(Dietvorst et al. 2018), and this could be the case in our study. For example, the AI system enables
customers to control the pace of service and customers have the freedom to decide when to transfer to
human agents. Such a user-friendly design may mitigate customers’ aversion to interacting with AI
systems as well as mitigate any potential increase in customers’ demand for human service.
Considering both sides of the arguments, it is unclear whether and to what extent the implementation
of a voiced-based AI system would influence customers’ demand for human services; thus, we seek to
test this relationship empirically.
Customer complaints. Customer complaints are manifestations of customers’ negative
service experience (Singh 1988). Firms expend significant effort to improve customer service
experience and reduce customer complaints. According to the service operations literature, firms
create standardized service routines to control service delivery and ensure a uniform service level
(Leidner 1993). Standardized service routines reflect the preference of service providers with regard
to the manner in which customer needs must be met, with the process steps being organized in a
particular order. The service processes are largely determined by average customer demands and
preferences (Victorino et al. 2013). Since they follow service routines designed for an average
customer, service systems lack flexibility, cannot spontaneously react to unforeseen situations (Groth
et al. 2009), and are likely to overlook customer heterogeneities (Ashforth and Fried 1988). Dealing
with customer heterogeneities (e.g., request and preference variations) was a major challenge for
service operations (Frei 2006), and flexibility is one of the important capabilities in operational design
(De Groote 1994, Aksin et al. 2007).
A diverse environment and heterogenous needs are best fitted with flexible technology (de
Groote 1994). Specifically, improving the degree of flexibility in how service systems react to
customer requests enables the delivery of customized services (Tansik and Smith 1991), thereby
enabling an enhancement of customers’ service experiences (Roth et al. 2006). For example,
Victorino et al. (2013) reported that customers’ perceived lower service quality from dinner
recommendation services provided by an employee who rigidly follows the service script. In contrast,
customers gave high ratings to service interactions in which the employee offers the flexibility of
reacting to customer varieties (Victorino et al. 2013). In addition, Heim and Sinha (2002) showed that
the flexibility of the service process in electronic retailing is positively associated with customer
satisfaction. However, increased flexibility in a rule-based service system could potentially be
accompanied by an increased complexity of the system, which makes it more likely to result in
subjective service failures.
In the context of our study, the voice-based AI system accommodates customers’
communication preference heterogeneities by enabling customers to express their service needs in
ways that are most suitable for them. Meanwhile, compared with the IVR system, the AI system
enhances the flexibility of service flows so that customers can directly locate their intended services,
switch among different services, and transfer to human agents whenever they want. Therefore, we
expect the implementation of the voice-based AI system to enhance customers’ experience and reduce
customer complaints; moreover, we also seek to empirically evaluate this effect.
4. Background and Data
4.1. Natural Field Experiment
Our study considers a natural field experiment conducted by a large telecommunication company’s
call center customer service, which serves as an important channel for customer-firm interaction
(Aksin et al. 2007). The company was established in 1995 and now has 14 branches and over 8,000
employees, providing services to over three million customers in a major city (covering an area of
approximately 53,100 km2) in northeast China, with a market share of 33%. The company rolled out
its voice-based AI system in its call center customer service system based on the last digit of customer
phone numbers. Figure 1 summarizes the timeline of the natural field experiment. Before Dec. 19,
2018, all service calls were connected to the IVR system. From Dec. 19, 2018, the AI system was
implemented to replace the IVR system for a certain portion of the company’s customers, which was
chosen on the basis of a set of randomly selected last digits of the customer’s phone number.
Specifically, service calls from phone numbers with the last digit 1 or 7 were connected to AI, while
calls from other phone numbers remained connected to the IVR system. Between Dec. 19 and Dec.
31, 2018, the updated service system was in the beta-testing phase and was not connected to the
internal databases. Therefore, no service records were stored. Beginning on Jan. 1, 2019, the AI
system was connected to internal databases with phone records stored. Thereafter, beginning Jan. 10,
2019, in addition to service calls from phone numbers ending in 1 or 7, service calls from phone
numbers ending in 3, 5, or 9 were also connected to the AI system. After Jan. 15, 2019, the AI system
completely replaced the IVR system.
Figure 1. Timeline of the Natural Field Experiment
While interacting with the AI-based system, customers verbally state their requests briefly
and the AI system provides instant responses based on the analysis of information input by the
customers. If customers do not describe their requests clearly, the AI system asks specific questions to
guide customers to providing more information so that the AI can route them to the specific services
in order to meet their needs (e.g., payments, check balance, temporarily stop service). If the IVR
system or AI system is unable to provide specific services that customers are looking for, the
customers have the option to be transferred to human agents. When interacting with the IVR system,
customers need to strictly follow pre-designed service flows. After navigating the entire voice
guidance on possible services, the system tells customers to press a specific number to be transferred
to human agents. In contrast, the AI-based system sets no restrictions on when and how customers can
transfer to human agents. At the beginning of the service, the AI system tells customers ―If you need
help from human agents, please say ‘Transfer to human agents’.‖
4.2. Data & Measures
The implementation of the voice-based AI system in call center customer service provides exogenous
variations on the type of service system (voice-based AI vs. IVR system) that a customer experiences.
The observation duration in our study was 30 days, including a 21-day pre-treatment period (Nov. 28
to Dec. 18, 2018) and a 9-day treatment period (Jan. 1–9, 2019).6 We exclude the beta-testing phase
between Dec. 19 and Dec. 31, 2018, because we were unable to observe the outcome variables during
this phase.
Our data set contains timestamps of customers’ phone call records, such as the start and end
times of service calls, customers’ profile information, such as age and gender, when a customer began
using the telecommunication service, as well as the transcripts of customer-AI conversations from all
the customers served by the company. We constructed the variable Call Length to measure a service
call’s duration using the difference between a call’s start and end times. Considering the skewed
distribution of Call Length (Gans et al. 2003), we log-transformed this variable in our estimations. In
addition, we constructed the variable Human Service to capture whether a customer transferred to
human agents in the service call. Further, extending the related research on customer service
6 In this natural field experiment, we have a nine-day treatment period (between Jan. 1 and Jan. 9, 2019, when the customers
with the last digit of phone number 7 connected to AI system vs. those with the last digit of phone number 9 connected to
IVR system). Also, a three-week pre-treatment period allows us to check the parallel trend of our key outcome variables
before the experiment (from Nov. 28 to Dec. 18, 2018, when all service calls were connected to the IVR system). In
addition, the cooperating telecommunication company designs its services on a monthly basis (e.g., customers choose a
monthly service package, charge bills for the next month). Taken together, we chose a 30-day observation window.
experiences in OM (Aksin et al. 2007), we considered customer complaints as one typical
consequence of negative service experiences. Here, we constructed the variable Customer Complaint
to capture whether the customer complained about the service within 30 minutes after a service call.
Following prior research on technology acceptance (Venkatesh et al. 2012), we also included
a few additional variables on the observable individual characteristics to understand whether
individual differences (e.g., age, gender, experience) moderate users’ acceptance and use of the
voice-based AI system. Specifically, we observed user age and gender. In addition, we constructed the
variable Service Tenure to measure how many years a customer has been using his or her phone
number and consider it a proxy for the customer’s experience using the IVR system. Table 2 presents
a summary of the operationalization of the main variables.

5. Methodology & Results
5.1. Econometric Identification
First, we processed the data to ensure comparability between our treatment and control groups in the
company’s natural field experiment. In the experiment, the group assignment hinges on the last digit
of the customers’ phone number, instead of randomly assigning customers to either the treatment or
control group. To ensure comparability of observations, given the lack of individual random
assignment, we tried to balance our samples before data analyses. If certain individuals prefer an even
number as the last digit, it may result in significant differences between the two groups (i.e., even
numbers vs. odd numbers); this is also observed in our data (see E-Companion B). To address this
issue, we first excluded data from customers with phone numbers that end in even numbers (i.e., 0, 2,
4, 6, and 8). Further, we conducted a series of pairwise comparisons of the observable covariates (i.e.,
Age, Gender, Service Tenure) and the pre-treatment values of outcome variables by the last digit of
the customers’ phone numbers (see Table B1 in E-Companion B). We found no significant
differences in the observable covariates across the groups of customers whose phone numbers end
with 7 and 9, as indicated in Table 3. Table 4 reports the descriptive statistics of the main variables.

with customers whose phone numbers end with 7 vs. 9.

To provide additional model-free evidence for the treatment effect and comparability of the
two groups, we also show the pre-treatment parallel trends of the outcome variables in Figures C1–C3
in E-Companion C. Overall, the evidence indicates that customer groups with the last digit as 7 vs. 9
are comparable. Thus, we opt to use the customer groups whose phone numbers ended with 7
(treated) and 9 (control) to estimate the effects of the AI-based system on the outcome variables in our
main analyses.
Thereafter, we performed difference-in-differences (DID) analyses to estimate the effects of
the voice-based AI system on service call length, customers’ need for human service, and customer
complaints. We specify the DID estimations with Equations (1), (2), and (3). In addition, we also
incorporate customer-level random effects in these estimations.7

7 In this paper, we selected random-effects models for two reasons. First, in our field experiment, randomization occurred
based on the last digit of the phone number. Thus, for the same customer, all his/her service records were either in the
treatment group or the control group. When conducting regressions with customer fixed effects, a few variables would have
been subsumed, like the variable AI_agent that indexes whether a record was in the treatment or control group, and dummies
that capture the features of specific customers (e.g., Age, Gender, Service Tenure) in the regression models. Second, for
dummy variables Human Service and Customer Complaint, the records of these variables with a value of 1 are relatively
sparse. If we chose fixed-effects models, many observation groups would have been omitted because of all negative
outcomes (i.e., Human Service = 0 or Customer Complaint = 0). In order to check the robustness of our results, we also
present the estimation results of fixed-effects models.

In the equations above, i denotes customers, and t denotes observation time; AI_agent is a
dummy variable, with 1 representing service calls from customers in the treatment group (i.e.,
customers whose phone numbers end with 7) and 0 representing service calls from customers in the
control group (i.e., customers whose phone numbers end with 9). After_AI is a dummy variable that
equals 1 for observations that took place after the introduction of the AI system and 0 for observations
on or prior to Dec. 18, 2018; Day Dummyt is a vector of time dummies representing each day during
our observational period; ui represents customer-specific random effects; and is the error term. In
Equation (1), the dependent variable is Log (Call Length). In Equations (2) and (3), we observed the
binary indicators of whether a call is transferred to human service and whether a call service
eventually received a customer complaint; we estimated these outcomes with logistic regressions. We
are interested in the coefficients of the interaction term, AI_agent * After_AI, as they capture the
effects of the AI system (compared with the IVR system) on the outcomes. For example, if the
coefficient in Equation (1) (i.e., ) is positive and statistically significant, it suggests that compared
with control customers—who used the IVR system and did not access the AI system—the treated
customers, who did use the AI system experienced longer average call length after the implementation
of the AI system.8
5.2. Main Findings
The regression estimations are presented in Tables 5 and 6, demonstrating the effects of the AI system
on Log (Call Length), Human Service, and Customer Complaint, respectively. To explore how the
durations of machine and human calls change after the implementation of the AI system, we separated
8 We also conducted a series of placebo tests to check whether the identified effects existed before the introduction of the AI
system or between customer groups who did not get access to the AI system. The results of the placebo tests are reported in
E-Companion D.
the duration of machine service (Machine_Call Length) from human service (Human_Call Length)9
and then conducted regressions. The results presented in Columns 1–4 in Table 5 suggest that the
implementation of voice-based AI significantly increases the duration of machine service by 5.65%
(i.e., 100 × ( −1) %) but exerts no effect on the duration of human service. These results indicate
that customers tend to spend more time interacting with the AI system as compared to the IVR
system. The results echo previous literature stating that, compared to mechanical self-service systems,
customers tend to engage more with natural language-based service robots (Huang and Rust 2021).
Specifically, diving into the records of customer-AI conversations, we found evidence for the wide
use of quest-irrelevant characteristics (e.g., the use of first- or second-person pronouns, politeness
expressions, and hesitation expressions), suggesting enhanced involvement during speech-based
interactions, which can lead to an increase in the service duration (Hauptmann and Rudnicky 1988, Le
Bigot et al. 2007).10 Meanwhile, per the results in Columns 5 and 6 in Table 5, we found inconclusive
evidence for the effects of the voice-based AI system on the total call length (i.e., Log (Call Length)).

9 Machine_Call Length measures the duration of a machine (i.e., AI or IVR) service, while Human_Call Length captures the
duration of a service delivered by human agents.
10 We examined the records of customer-AI conversations to provide possible explanations for the increase in call length
(particularly in machine call length) and found that, in 28.8% of the conversations, customers use first- or second-person
pronouns (e.g., ―I‖, ―you‖), suggesting enhanced involvement during conversations. In addition, approximately 21.3% of the
conversations include at least one utterance to express politeness (e.g., ―Thank you‖) and 16.0% of the conversations contain
hesitation expressions (e.g., ―Uh‖) when customers form utterances during conversations. Consistent with research on
interaction mode, all these quest-irrelevant characteristics in speech-based interactions—although making the interaction
more natural—can also lead to an increase in the service duration (Hauptmann and Rudnicky 1988, Le Bigot et al. 2007).

Notes: Standard errors are given in parentheses. ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, and *p < 0.1. In Columns 3 and 4, the
values of Human_Call Length are 0 for services successfully handled by the AI system or IVR system and we
calculated Log (Human_Call Length) = log (Human_Call Length + 1).
Table 6 reports the results from estimating Equations (2) and (3). Specifically, the estimates
presented in Columns 1 and 2 in Table 6 suggest that the introduction of a voice-based AI system
does not appear to exert a significant effect on customers’ demand for human service, even though it
is easier for customers to transfer to human agents when interacting with the voice-based AI system.
The above results provide null evidence on the possible negative consequence of implementing
voice-based AI in supporting customer service. When interacting with the AI system, customers can
choose to transfer to human agents at the beginning of the services, which may increase the workload
of human agents. However, we did not observe such an effect in our results. One possible explanation
for the results is that the AI-based service system in our research context enables customers to control
the service pace by transferring to human agents anytime they want. Giving customers the freedom to
control AI can reduce their aversion against AI (Dietvorst et al. 2018).

Notes: Standard errors are given in parentheses. ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, and *p < 0.1. In Columns 2 and 4, some
observations were excluded when we conducted logistic regressions considering customer fixed effects.
We also considered the effects of AI implementation on Customer Complaint. In Columns 3
and 4 in Table 6, we observed that the AI system significantly reduces customers’ likelihood of filing
complaint reports. We also quantified the magnitude of this effect in accordance with Hosmer et al.
(2013). Specifically, compared with the average Customer Complaint before the implementation of AI
in the sample (M = 0.013), we estimated that the implementation of AI reduces the probability of
customer complaints to 0.005 (i.e., 0.013 * / (1 + 0.013 * )), with a decrease of 61.54%
in customer complaints. As an extension to the literature that examines the impacts of AI-enabled
features in operation management, such as automation (Cui et al. 2021, Li and Li 2022) and smartness
(Cui et al. 2021), our results reveal that the service flexibility (a reflection of AI smartness) enhanced
by the AI systems does, indeed, improve the overall service performance. In E-Companion E, we
replicated our main analysis and found similar results from the data from customers with phone
numbers ending in odd numbers.
5.3. Additional Analyses
In the additional analyses, we first explored the heterogeneity in our main results (Section 5.3.1). Prior
work has demonstrated that user characteristics play critical roles in affecting the performance of
technology designs (Venkatesh and Morris 2000, Venkatesh et al. 2012), and we thus tested the
moderating effects of customer characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and service tenure). Next, we dived
into the customer-AI conversations and considered the consequences of possible AI service failure
(Section 5.3.2). Since AI cannot work perfectly to handle all service tasks, we tried to understand how
customer-AI interaction and AI’s speech-recognition failures influence customer service outcomes.
In addition, prior studies have found that individuals are more likely to accept and use new
technologies when they get used to them (Taylor and Todd 1995). In our research context, a customer
can use the call service system several times during our observation period. Therefore, in
E-Companion F, we further analyzed whether the effects of AI implementation change as customers
accumulate experience in interacting with the AI system. That is, the learning effects in customer-AI
interactions. Our results suggest that, for relatively simple requests, the implementation of
voice-based AI directly increases machine service duration and reduces customer complaints. When
dealing with complex requests (service calls handled by human agents), the AI system only reduces
customer complaints for customers who are experienced in using the AI system.
Finally, one potential explanation for the observed effects of the voice-based AI system on the
outcomes of interests is the novelty effect. For example, customers may be unfamiliar with the AI
system when the system is first introduced in the call center. In such a scenario, they are more likely
to spend a longer amount of time interacting with the AI system or they may be more tolerant of the
services provided by the AI system. In order to understand the possible novelty effect, in
E-Companion G, we re-estimated our regression equations in the main analysis by considering or
eliminating records on the voice-based AI system’s first- and second-time services for each customer.
The results suggest that the implementation of the AI system persistently reduces customer
complaints. However, possible novel effects of the AI system during the period of its early
introduction indicate that the duration of machine service and customer demand for human service
increases only temporarily after the introduction of the AI system and these effects are not significant
in the long term.
5.3.1. Heterogeneity by Customer Characteristics
After estimating the main effects of the AI system, we further examined how customer-level
covariates—including age, gender, and experience of using the IVR system—moderate the effects of
the voice-based AI system. The variable Service Tenure measures the number of years that a customer
has been using his/her phone number and we used it as a proxy for customers’ experience using the
IVR system. In terms of continuous variables, including Age and Service Tenure, we first
mean-centered these variables before constructing the interaction terms. Table 7 presents the results of
the moderation analyses.
As indicated in Panel A of Table 7, we found that Age moderates the effects of the AI system.
Specifically, older (vs. younger) customers may benefit more from the dialogue-based services
supported by AI, such that after the implementation of voice-based AI system, they spend less time on
call services, have less demand for human service, and register fewer complaints. In line with Meuter
et al. (2005), who found that older customers are not proficient at using traditional IVR systems and
thus are more reluctant to interact with these systems. Consequently, the convenience and flexibility
enabled by the voice-based AI system are more helpful for improving the service experience of older
customers. With regard to the moderating role of Gender in Panel B, the AI-based system is more
effective in reducing complaints from female customers (i.e., Gender = 0). Studies on the use of
self-service technology indicated that females are strongly influenced by their perceptions of ease of
use of technologies (Venkatesh and Morris 2000). Therefore, they experience a significant
improvement in AI-supported flexible services. Furthermore, we find that customers’ experience of
using the IVR system, Service Tenure, moderates the effect of the AI system on Customer Complaint
(Panel C). For customers who have more (vs. less) experience using the IVR system, the
implementation of the AI system has a greater effect in reducing their complaints. One possible
explanation for this is that experienced users are more familiar with the drawbacks of the IVR system
and more likely to appreciate the benefits of the AI system, thereby tending to have fewer complaints.
As an extension of prior literature that assumes service systems have the same service performance
for all customers (Khudyakov et al. 2010, Tezcan and Behzad 2012), our results indicate that the
effects of AI-based systems vary in terms of customer gender, age, and service tenure.

5.3.2. Speech-Recognition Failures in Customer-AI Interactions
We analyzed the transcripts of customer-AI conversations to examine how AI’s speech recognition
failures in customer-AI interactions may affect customers’ demand for human service and customer
complaints. To this end, we calculated the variable Failure_Count to measure the number of times
that the AI system failed to recognize a customer’s intention during a service call by counting the
number of times the AI system repeated the same question. On average, during our observational
window, approximately 28.5% of the customer-AI system service sessions involved
speech-recognition failures. We also measured Conversation_Count to quantify the rounds of
interaction between the AI system and a customer during a service call. Considering the skewed
distributions of the variables Failure_Count and Conversation_Count, we used the log-transformed
values of these variables in our regression estimations.11 Table 8 presents the results pertaining to
speech recognition failures of AI. The results suggest that Log(Conversation_Count) is negatively
related to Human Service and Customer Complaint. One possible explanation is that, for service

6. Discussion
6.1. Key Findings
This study investigates how the implementation of a voice-based AI system in call center customer
services affects customer behavior and call center performance. The results reveal several interesting
findings. First, we find that the voice-based AI system temporarily increases the duration of machine
service and customers’ demand for human service when the system is first introduced to customers,
but these effects were not significant after the customers gained experience with the AI system.
Second, the effects of the AI system on customer complaints vary in accordance with the complexity
of the customers’ service requests and the customers’ experience of using the AI system. Specifically,
the AI-system effectively reduces customer complaints for both experienced and inexperienced
customers when customers have relatively simple requests. In contrast, with regard to complex
requests, the AI system improves customers’ service experience only after they accrue sufficient
experience interacting with the AI system. Third, we explore how customer characteristics moderate
the effects of the AI system. The results reveal that the AI system is more helpful in reducing
complaints for older customers, female customers, and customers who are experienced in using the
IVR system.
6.2. Theoretical and Practical Implications
Our study contributes to the related literature on the application of AI systems and call center
customer service operations. To begin with, this work extends the literature on AI applications by
improving the understanding of the effects of AI systems in the customer service setting. Previous
studies have either focused on deploying AI-based algorithms to support or optimize operational
processes from the technical perspective (Senoner et al. 2021, Sun et al. 2022, Yang et al. 2022) or
examined the effects of different AI-enabled features in contexts such as price request (Cui et al.
2021), order decision-making (Li and Li 2022), and automated pricing (Karlinsky-Shichor and Netzer
2019). These studies mainly investigated certain advantages and drawbacks of AI-enabled automation
(Karlinsky-Shichor and Netzer 2019, Li and Li 2022, Cui et al. 2021) or smartness (Cui et al. 2021).
As an extension, our study explores the effectiveness of AI-enabled service flexibility—a specific
reflection of AI smartness—in call center customer service. Technology-based self-service systems
(e.g., ATMs) have already been demonstrated to work well in dealing with highly structured service
tasks (Barua et al. 1991), while our study suggests that AI-enabled service flexibility is more likely to
improve the service effectiveness when dealing with tasks with high variability (e.g., call center
services). Thus, IT investment decisions in service operations should match the features of both
service tasks and technologies.
In addition, prior studies have indicated that the realization of AI’s value in the context of
human-AI interaction crucially depends on institutional settings and the role that customers play in
using AI applications (Dietvorst et al. 2018, Luo et al. 2019). Often, customers are reluctant to interact
with AI when they passively receive AI-supported marketing information (Luo et al. 2019),
forecasting results (Dietvorst et al. 2015), or medical care (Longoni et al. 2019). However, our study
suggests that when customers have the freedom to control the flow and direction of the service, the
AI-based service system does not result in a significant increase in demand for human service, even
though the AI system allows customers to transfer to human agents at any time during the interaction.
Furthermore, our results offer preliminary insight into the negative effects of speech-recognition
failures on customer-AI system interactions, thereby enriching research on imperfect AI (Dietvorst et
al. 2015, 2018).
Our study also contributes to the literature on call center customer service operations by
investigating how AI technologies impact customer behavior and the performance of call center
customer service. Previous research has examined changes in call center customer service operations
elicited by technological advances, such as call center centralization (Adria and Chowdhury 2004),
flexible resource management (Kesavan et al. 2014), and outsourcing (Kocaga et al. 2015), but
limited attention has been paid to exploring the effects of the contact designs of different
technology-mediated services with direct customer involvement (Roth and Mentor 2003, Froehle and
Roth 2004). Moreover, the OM literature mainly focuses on measuring the performance of call center
customer services from the firm’s perspective, using easily trackable metrics, such as operational
costs (Tezcan and Behzad 2012) and wait time (Khudyakov et al. 2010, Singhal et al. 2019). There is
limited research on customers’ service experience (Aksin et al. 2007). Through the customers’
perspective, our study examines the effects of an AI-based service system on customer complaints,
which is a key consequence of customers’ negative service experiences. We find that customers tend
to make fewer complaints when served by the voice-based AI system. In addition, enriching prior
studies that treat customers as homogeneous and use a single metric to represent the performance of
service systems for all customers (Khudyakov et al. 2010, Tezcan and Behzad 2012), this study
further examines how the effects of the AI-based system vary in accordance with customers
characteristics, such as age, gender, and experience in using the traditional IVR system.
Furthermore, our findings also have important practical implications. First, we find that the
implementation of the voice-based AI system in call center customer services helps improve customer
service experiences (i.e., reduces customer complaints) and that the flexibility of transferring to
human agents, enabled by the AI system, does not lead to a significant increase in customers’ demand
for human service in the long term. These findings showcase the value of voice-based AI systems in
the provision of customer service. Thus, companies can continue implementing AI systems to support
customer services. Second, our findings also shed light on bridging the
proof-of-concept-to-production gap (Perry 2021). We find that the effectiveness of the AI system is
closely dependent on the service tasks (e.g., the complexity of customers’ service requests) and
customers’ experience of using AI systems. As predicted, the implementation of the AI system
directly improves customers’ service experience in relatively simple service tasks. In terms of
handling complex requests, the voice-based AI system only operates effectively to reduce complaints
from customers who have gained enough knowledge about the interacted AI system. Thus, users may
suffer the proof-of-concept-to-production gap in the early stages of adoption, particularly when
dealing with complex tasks (Sodhi et al. 2022). Correspondingly, customer service operations that are
equipped with AI systems can initially distinguish simple customer requests from complex ones based
on historical service records and then encourage customers with simple requests to use AI-assisted
services. Platforms can consider guiding customers to establish appropriate expectations of the AI
system and transfer customers with complex requests to human agents as quickly as possible. Third,
our results indicate the possible novelty effect of a newly implemented AI system. We find that the
duration of machine service and customers’ need for human service temporally increases after the
introduction of the AI system. Companies can take these effects into account when scheduling
resources for their newly implemented AI-based service systems. Moreover, in our study, suggestive
evidence from customer-AI conversations reveals that customers are more likely to turn to human
agents and complain about services after experiencing speech-recognition failures. This is likely not a
huge concern in the longer run, as AI-based services are likely to improve in terms of speech
recognition, given their learning capabilities.
6.3. Limitations and Future Research
Our study has several limitations, which also indicate ample opportunities for future research. First,
our experimental randomization is based on the last digit of customers’ phone numbers, rather than
being performed at the individual level, and thus, we balanced our samples before data analysis.
Second, due to data limitations, we could not observe detailed records of specific service requests
handled by the IVR system; therefore, we were unable to categorize service requests based on
objective service types. It will be interesting for future researchers to extend our findings based on the
objective complexity of customer service requests. Third, the current study focuses on the effects of a
voice-based AI system on call length, customers’ demand for human service, and customer
complaints. Future research could explore other outcome variables, such as service satisfaction,
customer retention, and future customer engagement, which reflect the value of AI implementation for
businesses. Moreover, leveraging the transcripts of customer-AI conversations, we conducted a few
preliminary analyses on customer-AI interactions by examining the negative effects of
speech-recognition failures. It would be interesting for future research to explore other factors in
human-AI interactions, such as emotions expressed by AI and service tones used by AI in
conversations, which inform the design of voice-based AI systems. Lastly, we analyze the
effectiveness of deploying a voice-based AI system to replace the traditional IVR system in the
telecommunication customer service setting in China. The generalizability of our findings might be
subject to the technical designs of the AI and IVR systems, cultural variation, as well as differences in
levels of technology development among countries, all of which may affect users’ attitude to and
adoption of AI. Thus, we encourage future research to further explore the implications of voice-based
AI systems among different user populations or in other service settings.
