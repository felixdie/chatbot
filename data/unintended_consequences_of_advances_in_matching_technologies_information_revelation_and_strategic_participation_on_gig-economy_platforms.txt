Abstract 


Recent 
years 
have 
witnessed 
significant 
advancements 
in 
matching 
technologies 
used 
to 
improve 
the 
matching 
between 
workers 
and 
employers 
requesting 
job 
tasks 
on 
a 
gig-economy 
platform. 
While 
conventional 
wisdom 
suggests 
that 
technologies 
with 
higher 
matching 
quality 
benefit 
the 
platform 
by 
assigning 
better-matched 
jobs 
to 
workers, 
we 
discover 
a 
possible 
unintended 
revenue-decreasing 
e 
ect. 
Our 
stylized 
game-theoretic 
model 
suggests 
that 
while 
a 
technology’s 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect 
can 
increase 
a 
platform’s 
revenue, 
the 
jobs 
assigned 
by 
the 
better 
matching 
technology 
can 
also 
unintentionally 
reveal 
more 
information 
about 
uncertain 
labor 
demand 
to 
workers, 
especially 
when 
demand 
is 
low, 
and 
thus 
unfavorably 
change 
workers’ 
participation 
decisions, 
resulting 
in 
a 
revenue 
loss 
for 
the 
platform. 
We 
extend 
our 
model 
to 
cases 
in 
which 
(1) 
the 
share 
of 
revenue 
between 
workers 
and 
platform 
is 
endogenous, 
(2) 
the 
matching 
quality 
can 
be 
improved 
continuously, 
(3) 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
workers 
is 
a 
ected 
by 
competition 
between 
platforms, 
and 
(4) 
workers 
compete 
for 
job 
tasks. 
We 
find 
consistent 
results 
with 
additional 
insights, 
including 
the 
optimal 
matching 
quality 
that 
a 
platform 
should 
pursue. 
Furthermore, 
we 
examine 
two 
approaches 
to 
mitigate 
the 
potential 
negative 
e 
ect 
of 
employing 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
for 
the 
platform, 
and 
find 
that 
under 
certain 
conditions, 
the 
platform 
can 
benefit 
from 
revealing 
labor 
demand 
or 
competition 
information 
directly 
to 
workers. 
Our 
results 
shed 
light 
on 
both 
the 
intended 
positive 
and 
unintended 
negative 
e 
ects 
of 
improvements 
in 
matching 
quality, 
and 
also 
highlight 
the 
importance 
of 
thoughtful 
development, 
management, 
and 
application 
of 
matching 
technologies 
in 
the 
gig 
economy.

Introduction 


Gig-economy 
platforms 
(e.g., 
Uber, 
Lyft, 
and 
Instacart), 
defined 
as 
digital, 
service-based, 
on-demand 
platforms 
that 
enable 
flexible 
work 
arrangements 
(Greenwood 
et 
al., 
2017), 
have 
attracted 
growing 
participation 
of 
workers 
and 
employers 
in 
recent 
years 
(Chen 
et 
al., 
2019; 
Huang 
et 
al., 
2020). 
Gig 
workers 
actively 
engage 
in 
short-term 
job 
tasks 
and 
temporary 
freelance 
projects 
requested 
by 
employers 
on 
such 
platforms 
(Allon 
et 
al., 
2018; 
Hall 
and 
Krueger, 
2018). 
Given 
the 
significant 
number 
of 
workers 
and 
tasks 
requested 
in 
the 
rapidly 
growing 
gig 
economy, 
work 
assignments 
(i.e., 
matching 
workers 
and 
tasks) 
are 
often 
coordinated 
by 
platforms 
and 
facilitated 
by 
advances 
in 
matching 
technologies 
(Burtch 
et 
al., 
2018; 
Sundararajan, 
2014). 


To 
better 
manage 
job 
tasks 
for 
gig 
workers, 
managers 
of 
gig-economy 
platforms 
have 
been 
investing 
aggressively 
in 
developing 
and 
integrating 
automated 
and 
algorithmic 
matching 
systems 
(Moore, 
2019). 
Recent 
years 
have 
seen 
a 
rise 
in 
the 
application 
of 
data 
mining 
and 
machine 
learning 
algorithms 
(with 
artificial 
intelligence 
(AI) 
at 
its 
contemporary 
status) 
in 
matching 
technologies. 
These 
new 
technologies 
can 
automatically 
discern 
patterns 
from 
large 
amounts 
of 
data, 
recognize 
the 
optimal 
mapping 
between 
the 
supply 
and 
demand 
of 
the 
labor 
market, 
and 
significantly 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
matching 
for 
platforms. 
As 
matching 
technologies 
continue 
to 
improve, 
they 
start 
to 
take 
on 
managerial 
roles 
to 
revolutionize 
the 
gig 
workspace 
by 
autonomously 
evaluating 
job 
tasks 
to 
deliver 
better 
matches 
between 
workers 
and 
employers 
(Cameron, 
2020; 
Lee 
et 
al., 
2015). 
They 
are 
expected 
to 
become 
significant 
drivers 
for 
increasing 
workers’ 
productivity 
and 
platforms’ 
operational 
performance, 
ultimately 
generating 
higher 
revenues 
for 
both 
(Cramer 
and 
Krueger, 
2016; 
Faraj 
et 
al., 
2018). 


While 
the 
industry 
sees 
significant 
promise 
from 
advancements 
in 
matching 
technologies, 
limited 
attention 
has 
been 
given 
to 
how 
worker 
behaviors 
may 
be 
influenced 
by 
the 
employment 
of 
such 
technologies, 
aside 
from 
their 
apparent 
benefit 
in 
improving 
matching 
quality. 
Unlike 
traditional 
workers 
with 
fixed 
schedules, 
gig 
workers 
are 
more 
independent, 
possessing 
greater 
autonomy 
and 
flexibility 
in 
setting 
their 
own 
work 
schedules. 
Specifically, 
gig 
workers 
can 
decide 
strategically 
whether 
to 
participate 
on 
a 
gig-economy 
platform 
based 
on 
information 
revealed 
by 
job 
tasks 
assigned 
on 
the 
platform 
by 
its 
matching 
technology 
(Cameron, 
2020; 
Lee 
et 
al., 
2015). 
For 
example, 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms 
that 
o 
er 
delivery 
service, 
couriers 
can 
choose 
not 
to 
work 
for 
the 
platform 
at 
certain 
times 
if 
the 
expected 
payo 
does 
not 
o 
set 
the 
cost 
of 
working 
(Shapiro, 
2018). 
On 
ride-hailing 
platforms, 
drivers 
can 
perceive 
the 
matching 
technology 
and 
infer 
demand 
information 
from 
the 
matching 
outcome 
to 
plan 
their 
work 
schedules 
(Cameron, 
2020; 
Zhang 
et 
al., 
2022). 
The 
adoption 
of 
a 
well-performed 
matching 
technology 
may 
induce 
workers’ 
strategic 
participation 
because 
of 
the 
additional 
information 
potentially 
revealed 
by 
better-matched 
outcomes. 
This 
strategic 
reaction 
of 
workers 
to 
job 
assignments 
can 
sometimes 
lead 
to 
a 
reduced 
labor 
supply 
that 
is 
insu 
cient 
to 
meet 
demand 
and 
consequently, 
a 


1 





revenue 
loss 
for 
the 
platform. 


Specifically, 
when 
matching 
quality 
is 
high, 
matching 
outcomes 
can, 
under 
certain 
conditions, 
reflect 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
demand 
of 
labor 
markets 
that 
was 
uncertain 
to 
workers 
before 
seeing 
any 
matching 
outcomes. 
That 
is, 
along 
with 
the 
employers 
assigned 
to 
the 
workers 
by 
a 
better 
matching, 
information 
about 
uncertain 
labor 
demand 
can 
sometimes 
be 
unintentionally 
disclosed 
to 
workers 
and 
promote 
their 
autonomy 
by 
updating 
their 
beliefs 
about 
the 
true 
demand. 
For 
example, 
if 
a 
poor-match 
job 
task 
is 
assigned 
by 
a 
technology 
with 
good 
matching 
quality, 
then 
the 
workers 
may 
speculate 
that 
labor 
demand 
is 
likely 
low 
(because 
otherwise 
a 
better-match 
job 
task 
would 
have 
been 
assigned 
to 
them) 
and 
continuing 
to 
spend 
time 
working 
may 
not 
be 
profitable; 
as 
a 
result, 
such 
workers 
may 
strategize 
and 
exercise 
their 
discretions 
to 
suspend 
work.1 
Such 
an 
unfavorable 
strategic 
reaction 
might 
not 
be 
triggered 
if 
the 
matching 
quality 
was 
low, 
because 
the 
worker 
would 
not 
rule 
out 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
poor-match 
job 
task 
was 
caused 
by 
the 
poor 
matching 
technology 
rather 
than 
caused 
by 
the 
low 
demand. 
As 
gig-economy 
platforms 
are 
designed 
to 
support 
flexible 
work 
arrangements 
(Chen 
et 
al., 
2019) 
and 
need 
consent 
from 
gig 
workers 
before 
assigning 
work, 
workers’ 
sense 
of 
autonomy 
being 
reinforced 
by 
demand 
signals 
from 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
may 
be 
unavoidable, 
potentially 
leading 
to 
an 
unexpected 
loss 
of 
revenue 
for 
a 
platform. 


Therefore, 
two 
e 
ects 
brought 
by 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
better 
technology 
to 
match 
workers 
and 
employers 
jointly 
determine 
the 
overall 
revenue 
of 
a 
gig-economy 
platform: 
increased 
worker 
performance 
that 
results 
from 
improved 
matching 
quality 
(named 
as 
the 
“matching 
enhancement 
eect”) 
and 
the 
demand 
information 
revealed 
by 
matching 
outcomes, 
which 
can 
sometimes 
lead 
to 
workers’ 
strategic 
participation 
decisions 
(named 
as 
the 
“information 
revelation 
eect”). 
The 
platform 
can 
obviously 
benefit 
from 
a 
revenue 
boost 
because 
of 
this 
“matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect” 
that 
results 
from 
technologies 
with 
stronger 
matching 
capabilities. 
However, 
workers 
may 
strategically 
respond 
to 
job 
assignments 
facilitated 
by 
a 
better 
matching 
technology, 
taking 
advantage 
of 
disclosed 
labor 
demand 
information 
to 
compare 
expected 
payo 
s 
and 
opportunity 
costs 
of 
continuing 
their 
participation 
(Agrawal 
et 
al., 
2018). 
This 
strategic 
participation 
can 
influence 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
positively 
or 
negatively, 
depending 
on 
the 
information 
revealed. 
Ultimately, 
how 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
is 
a 
ected 
by 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
is 
thus 
inconclusive 
and 
determined 
by 
the 
possible 
trade-o 
between 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect 
and 
the 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect. 
Motivated 
by 
this 
trade-o 
, 
in 
this 
study, 
we 
seek 
to 
answer 
the 
following 
research 
questions: 
1) 
How 
does 
the 
matching 
outcome 
from 
a 
matching 
technology 
with 
greater 
matching 
quality 
motivate 
or 
demotivate 
workers 
and, 
in 
turn, 
a 
ect 
their 
decisions 
to 
participate 
on 
a 
gig-economy 
platform 
and 
perform 
job 
activities? 
2) 
Given 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
two 
potentially 
countervailing 
e 
ects, 
to 
what 
extent 
will 


1Generally, 
these 
strategic 
behaviors 
are 
neither 
rewarded 
nor 
penalized 
as 
long 
as 
workers 
engage 
with 
the 
job 
task 
assigned 
by 
a 
matching 
technology 
as 
intended 
or 
in 
a 
way 
that 
is 
not 
explicitly 
against 
platform 
policy 
(Cameron, 
2020).

from 
adopting 
a 
better

with 
greater

quality 
in 
its 
job 
assignment?

addition, 
how 
will

of 
workers 
and 
the

3) 
When 
a 
gig-economy 
platform 
does 
not 
benefit 
from 
adopting 
a 
matching 
technology 
with 
greater 
matching 
quality, 
how 
can 
the 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
platform 
be 
mitigated? 


To 
address 
these 
research 
questions, 
we 
develop 
a 
stylized 
model 
to 
take 
into 
account 
two 
e 
ects 
– 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect 
and 
the 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
– 
driven 
by 
advances 
in 
matching 
technologies 
that 
could 
alter 
worker 
participation 
behavior 
on 
a 
gig-economy 
platform. 
We 
explore 
the 
circumstances 
under 
which 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
deployed 
on 
a 
gig-economy 
platform 
may 
have 
unintended 
negative 
consequences 
on 
the 
platform’s 
total 
revenue. 
We 
consider 
two 
di 
erent 
types 
of 
job 
tasks: 
good-match 
and 
poor-match 
job 
tasks. 
When 
adopted 
by 
the 
platform, 
the 
matching 
technology 
with 
greater 
matching 
quality 
selects 
from 
available 
tasks 
and 
assigns 
to 
a 
worker 
a 
better-
matched 
job 
task 
that 
generates 
not 
only 
a 
higher 
payo 
for 
the 
worker 
but 
also 
higher 
revenue 
for 
the 
platform 
as 
well. 
For 
a 
given 
demand 
situation, 
good-match 
job 
tasks 
may 
not 
always 
be 
available; 
at 
times, 
only 
poor-match 
job 
tasks 
may 
be 
available 
and 
thus 
assigned 
to 
the 
worker. 
When 
demand 
is 
uncertain, 
the 
worker, 
upon 
observing 
a 
job 
task 
assigned 
by 
the 
matching 
technology, 
can 
infer 
the 
labor 
demand 
information 
and 
update 
her 
belief 
about 
the 
uncertain 
demand 
on 
the 
platform 
in 
a 
Bayesian 
manner. 
For 
example, 
the 
worker 
may 
attribute 
a 
poor-match 
job 
assignment 
to 
low 
labor 
demand, 
knowing 
that 
the 
matching 
technology 
with 
greater 
matching 
quality 
would 
have 
assigned 
a 
better-match 
job 
if 
the 
demand 
condition 
were 
better. 
Our 
model 
analyzes 
the 
impact 
of 
adopting 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
to 
determine 
job 
assignments 
on 
workers’ 
decision 
to 
continue 
participating 
on 
the 
platform 
and 
the 
resultant 
change 
in 
the 
platform’s 
overall 
revenue. 


We 
first 
compare 
the 
outcome 
of 
adopting 
a 
perfectly 
accurate 
matching 
technology 
to 
the 
result 
from 
our 
baseline 
scenario: 
when 
a 
job 
task 
is 
randomly 
assigned 
to 
a 
worker. 
We 
find 
that 
while 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect 
from 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
can 
increase 
platform 
revenue 
by 
improving 
matching 
quality 
and 
worker 
performance, 
the 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
that 
undermines 
worker 
participation 
can 
dominate 
under 
some 
circumstances, 
resulting 
in 
lower 
overall 
revenue 
for 
the 
platform. 
This 
negative 
impact 
linked 
to 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
happens 
when 
good-match 
and 
poor-match 
job 
tasks 
do 
not 
di 
er 
significantly 
in 
value 
and 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
for 
workers 
to 
participate 
is 
in 
the 
intermediate 
region. 
This 
result 
highlights 
the 
importance 
for 
gig-economy 
platforms 
to 
fully 
understand 
the 
consequences 
of 
adopting 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
beyond 
the 
consideration 
of 
matching 
quality 
itself. 


We 
then 
consider 
the 
range 
of 
improvement 
in 
matching 
accuracy 
to 
investigate 
the 
optimal 
level 
of 
matching 
accuracy 
that 
gig-economy 
platforms 
should 
pursue. 
We 
find 
that 
as 
the 
matching 
quality 
of 
the 
technology 
improves, 
the 
platform 
is 
not 
necessarily 
better 
o 
. 
Specifically, 
there 
is 
a 
non-
monotonic 
relationship 
between 
the 
level 
of 
matching 
accuracy 
and 
a 
platform’s 
revenue. 
Thus, 
for 


3 





a 
gig-economy 
platform 
that 
is 
designed 
to 
support 
flexible 
work 
arrangements, 
a 
perfectly 
accurate 
matching 
technology 
is 
not 
necessarily 
optimal, 
even 
if 
improving 
matching 
quality 
is 
costless. 


We 
then 
extend 
our 
model 
to 
the 
case 
in 
which 
we 
endogenize 
the 
share 
of 
revenue 
between 
the 
workers 
and 
the 
platform 
and 
the 
case 
in 
which 
we 
consider 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
for 
workers 
to 
begin 
participating 
on 
the 
platform. 
We 
also 
extend 
our 
model 
to 
the 
case 
in 
which 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
workers 
is 
endogenous 
and 
a 
ected 
by 
the 
competition 
between 
platforms, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
case 
in 
which 
workers 
do 
not 
work 
independently 
but 
engage 
in 
labor 
competition 
for 
job 
assignments. 
Our 
insights 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
two 
competing 
e 
ects 
driven 
by 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
persist 
in 
our 
model 
extensions. 
In 
addition, 
we 
find 
that 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
competing 
platform, 
a 
platform 
may 
still 
prefer 
not 
to 
adopt 
a 
more 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
due 
to 
the 
possible 
negative 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect, 
which 
happens 
when 
the 
platform 
has 
some 
advantage, 
albeit 
slight, 
in 
other 
dimensions 
(e.g., 
reputation, 
service 
quality) 
compared 
to 
its 
competitor. 
The 
extension 
on 
interdependent 
workers 
shows 
that 
a 
platform 
is 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
hurt 
by 
adopting 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
if 
worker 
preferences 
are 
more 
diversified; 
this 
finding 
leads 
to 
our 
discussion 
of 
possible 
solutions 
that 
encourage 
revealing 
information 
in 
order 
to 
mitigate 
the 
potential 
negative 
impact 
of 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
on 
a 
gig-economy 
platform. 


Specifically, 
we 
examine 
two 
approaches 
to 
mitigate 
the 
potential 
negative 
e 
ect 
of 
a 
better 
matching 
for 
a 
platform. 
We 
find 
that 
a 
platform 
can 
be 
better 
o 
by 
revealing 
the 
labor 
demand 
or 
competition 
information 
directly 
to 
workers 
under 
certain 
conditions. 
When 
we 
compare 
two 
approaches, 
we 
find 
that 
when 
platform 
revenue 
decreases 
because 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted, 
revealing 
demand 
information 
outperforms 
revealing 
competition 
information. 
This 
result 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
fact 
that, 
in 
practice, 
we 
often 
observe 
gig-economy 
platforms 
reveal 
real-time 
demand 
information 
to 
their 
workers, 
rather 
than 
competition 
information. 


Lastly, 
we 
provide 
policy 
implications 
of 
our 
model 
by 
studying 
the 
impact 
of 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
on 
worker 
surplus 
and 
the 
total 
welfare 
of 
workers 
and 
the 
platform. 
We 
find 
that 
a 
matching 
technology 
with 
greater 
matching 
quality 
generally 
increases 
worker 
surplus, 
as 
it 
provides 
additional 
information 
about 
the 
labor 
market 
for 
workers 
to 
evaluate, 
unless 
the 
platform 
intervenes 
by 
means 
such 
as 
altering 
commission 
rates 
based 
on 
technology 
levels. 
That 
said, 
total 
welfare 
is 
not 
always 
improved 
by 
a 
better 
matching 
technology. 
It 
is 
also 
a 
ected 
by 
both 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
and 
information 
revelation 
e 
ects. 
Consequently, 
the 
possible 
decrease 
in 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
is 
not 
merely 
a 
redistribution 
of 
welfare 
across 
di 
erent 
parties. 


Our 
study 
bridges 
several 
strands 
of 
literature 
on 
the 
design 
of 
digital 
platforms, 
algorithmic 
management, 
and 
the 
gig 
economy. 
Our 
work 
adds 
to 
the

forms 
can 
adopt 
an 
advanced 
matching

that 
helps 
reduce 
transaction 
costs 
and 
matching 
frictions 
by 
processing 
a 
sheer

of 
market

to 
identify 
the 
optimal 
match 
between 
workers 
and 
employers 
requesting

(Einav 
et

2016). 
We 
show, 
however, 
that 
the 
job

assigned 
by 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
can 
motivate 
or 
demotivate 
workers 
to 
participate 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms. 
Furthermore, 
we 
advance 
the 
growing 
literature 
on 
algorithmic 
management 
in 
the 
gig 
economy, 
which 
provides 
initial 
anecdotal 
evidence 
of 
gig 
workers’ 
responses 
to 
algorithmic 
job

(e.g., 
Cameron, 
2020; 
Tambe 
et 
al., 
2019; 
Zhang 
et 
al., 
2022). 
To 
the 
best 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
our 
study 
is 
one 
of 
the 
first 
to 
develop 
a 
comprehensive 
analytical 
model 
to 
systematically 
examine 
the 
interaction 
between 
human 
workers 
and 
matching

which 
are 
improved 
by 
advances 
in 
algorithms, 
and 
analyze 
their 
impact 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms’ 
revenue. 
While 
we 
point 
out 
the 
possible 
negative 
consequences 
of 
technologies 
with 
greater

quality, 
we 
also 
provide 
actionable 
solutions 
to 
alleviate 
such 
consequences 
that 
are 
not 
intended 
by 
platforms. 
As 
matching 
technologies 
are 
essential 
for 
determining 
work 
arrangements 
in 
the

our

underscores 
the 
importance 
of 
understanding 
both

Related 
Literature 


The 
gig 
economy’s 
prominence 
can 
be 
traced 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
peer-to-peer 
marketplace 
mediated 
by 
digital 
platforms 
(Einav 
et 
al., 
2016). 
These 
platforms 
create 
labor 
markets 
by 
facilitating 
transactions 
between 
workers 
(i.e., 
service 
providers) 
and 
employers 
requesting 
job 
tasks. 
They 
create 
employment 
forms 
that 
are 
service-based, 
on-demand, 
and, 
more 
importantly, 
enabling 
a 
flexible 
working 
environment 
for 
workers 
(Chen 
et 
al., 
2019; 
Greenwood 
et 
al., 
2017). 


The 
development 
of 
gig-economy 
platforms 
and 
their 
implications 
for 
business 
and 
society 
have 
received 
wide 
attention 
in 
the 
information 
systems 
(IS) 
literature. 
Existing 
work 
has 
mainly 
touched 
on 
three 
diverse 
topics: 
(1) 
workers’ 
labor 
supply 
decisions 
related 
to 
worker 
characteristics 
and 
motivations 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
gig 
economy 
(e.g., 
He 
et 
al., 
2021; 
Huang 
et 
al., 
2020), 
(2) 
platform 
design 
for 
increasing 
market 
e 
ciencies 
(e.g., 
Deng 
et 
al., 
2016; 
Hong 
et 
al., 
2016; 
Horton, 
2017;

Mo 
et 
al., 
2018), 
and 
(3) 
the 
socioeconomic 
impact 
of 
these 
platforms 
(e.g., 
ride-sharing 
platforms 
can 
reduce 
tra 
c 
congestion 
(Li 
et 
al., 
2016) 
and 
the 
rate 
of 
alcohol-related 
motor 
vehicle 
fatalities 
(Greenwood 
and 
Wattal, 
2017), 
food-delivering 
platforms 
can 
help 
small 
restaurants 
survive 
during 
the 
COVID-19 
crisis 
(Raj 
et 
al., 
2020)). 
Our 
work 
is 
closely 
related 
to 
studies 
on 
the 
design 
of 
gig-economy 
platforms 
to 
incentivize 
workers’ 
participation 
and 
enhance 
market 
e 
ciencies 
by 
reducing 
transaction 
costs 
and 
matching 
frictions. 
Such 
platforms 
develop 
and 
adopt 
matching 
technologies 
to 
leverage 
substantial 
market 
information 
and 
identify 
best 
matches 
between 
employers 
and 
workers 
(Einav 
et 
al., 
2016; 
Daniels 
and 
Turcic, 
2021).2 
In 
particular, 
for 
app 
work-based 
gig-economy 
platforms 
(e.g., 
on-demand 
ride-hailing 
and 
delivery 
platforms), 
it 
is 
important 
to 
ensure 
a 
su 
cient 
supply 
of 
gig 
workers 
to 
meet 
the 
demand 
of 
employers 
and 
centralize 
the 
time-sensitive 
matching 
process 
(Yan 
et 
al., 
2020).3 


Advances 
in 
matching 
technology 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
matching 
in 
the 
gig 
economy 
by 
developing 
algorithms 
for 
automated 
matching 
(Azevedo 
and 
Weyl, 
2016). 
Algorithms, 
as 
computer-programmed 
procedures 
for 
transforming 
input 
data 
into 
desired 
outputs 
(Gillespie, 
2014), 
are 
central 
to 
advances 
in 
matching 
technology 
and 
time-sensitive 
processes 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms 
(Cameron, 
2020). 
The 
algorithms 
can 
be 
used 
to 
automatically 
identify 
and 
assign 
a 
job 
task 
to 
a 
worker 
at 
a 
given 
time. 
For 
example, 
in 
the 
ride-hailing 
industry, 
Uber’s 
algorithm 
can 
track 
and 
analyze 
location 
data 
from 
GPS 
or 
other 
sensors 
in 
riders’ 
and 
drivers’ 
smartphones 
(Duggan 
et 
al., 
2020), 
and 
initially 
performed 
matching 
based 
on 
the 
shortest 
distance 
between 
riders 
and 
drivers. 
But 
closest 
does 
not 
always 
mean 
quickest 
(Uber, 
2022). 
The 
matching 
algorithm 
was 
then 
improved 
to 
a 
time-based 
approach 
in 
which 
a 
rider 
is 
matched 
to 
the 
driver 
with 
the 
fastest 
estimated 
time 
of 
arrival 
(ETA) 
(Lekach, 
2019). 
As 
the 
platform 
scaled 
with 
more 
workers 
and 
job 
tasks 
over 
the 
years, 
Uber 
developed 
a 
batching 
algorithm 
to 
advance 
its 
matching 
technology 
(Uber, 
2022). 
For 
each 
rider, 
instead 
of 
matching 
the 
individual 


2Prior 
studies 
classify 
gig 
work 
into 
three 
major 
categories: 
app 
work 
(e.g., 
Uber, 
Lyft, 
Deliveroo), 
crowd 
work 
(e.g., 
Amazon 
Mechanical 
Turk, 
Fiverr), 
and 
capital 
platform 
work 
(e.g., 
Airbnb, 
Etsy) 
(Duggan 
et 
al., 
2020; 
Zhang 
et 
al., 
2022). 
We 
primarily 
focus 
on 
app 
work-based 
platforms 
for 
which 
technologies 
for 
automatic 
matching 
are 
required. 
The 
matching 
technologies 
need 
to 
automatically 
identify 
and 
assign 
a 
job 
task 
to 
a 
worker 
at 
a 
time, 
while 
in 
crowd 
work 
and 
capital 
platform 
work, 
employers 
requesting 
job 
tasks 
need 
to 
select 
from 
a 
list 
of 
potentially 
matched 
gig 
workers, 
and 
then 
make 
a 
final 
matching 
decision. 


3For 
example, 
in 
the 
process 
of 
matching 
drivers 
(gig 
workers) 
to 
riders 
(employers) 
on 
ride-hailing 
platforms 
such 
as 
Uber 
and 
Lyft, 
riders 
are 
generally 
happy 
to 
delegate 
the 
matching 
to 
the 
platforms, 
provided 
that 
they 
arrive 
at 
their 
destinations 
quickly 
and 
safely 
(Einav 
et 
al., 
2016). 
Riders 
pay 
less 
attention 
to 
car 
features 
or 
driver 
characteristics. 
Instead 
of 
letting 
riders 
choose 
from 
a 
list 
of 
drivers, 
the 
platforms 
adopting 
centralized 
matching 
strategy 
can 
lower 
transaction 
costs 
by 
reducing 
unnecessary 
delays 
and 
prescreening 
unqualified 
drivers. 
Food 
and 
grocery 
delivery 
platforms, 
such 
as 
Deliveroo 
and 
Instacart, 
adopt 
similar 
centralized 
matching 
processes, 
although 
they 
may 
be 
less 
constrained 
in 
response 
time 
due 
to 
a 
lower 
level 
of 
urgency 
for 
the 
service 
(Yan 
et 
al., 
2020). 
However, 
during 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
the 
demand 
for 
food 
delivery 
rose 
dramatically 
and 
placed 
significantly 
higher 
pressure 
on 
providing 
service 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
(Forman, 
2021; 
DiSalvo, 
2021). 
In 
comparison, 
other 
types 
of 
platforms 
that 
face 
less 
time 
constraints 
and 
have 
users 
with 
stronger 
preferences 
for 
making 
selection 
decisions 
perform 
matching 
in 
a 
decentralized 
manner 
(such 
as 
TaskRabbit 
for 
household 
tasks 
and 
Airbnb 
for 
hospitality 
service) 
(Einav 
et 
al., 
2016). 
The 
decentralized 
matching 
process 
begins 
with 
employers 
who 
request 
service 
specifying 
what 
they 
need. 
The 
platforms 
then 
oer 
matching 
suggestions 
of 
gig 
workers 
to 
their 
employers; 
the 
final 
decisions, 
however, 
are 
made 
by 
these 
participants 
(Yan 
et 
al., 
2020).

rider 
to 
that 
rider’s 
closest 
driver, 
the 
algorithm 
would 
find 
the 
best 
match 
for 
a 
“batch” 
of 
riders 
and 
drivers 
-that 
is, 
a 
group 
of 
nearby 
drivers 
and 
people 
requesting 
rides 
in 
an 
area 
at 
the 
same 
time 
(Lekach, 
2019). 
Thus, 
Uber 
optimizes 
its 
matching 
algorithm 
by 
reducing 
wait 
time 
for 
riders 
and 
idle 
time 
for 
drivers 
across 
the 
entire 
“batch” 
or 
group. 


Furthermore, 
recent 
years 
have 
seen 
a 
rise 
in 
the 
application 
of 
data 
mining 
and 
machine 
learning 
algorithms 
in 
matching 
technologies. 
These 
new 
technologies 
can 
automatically 
discern 
patterns 
from 
large 
amounts 
of 
data, 
recognize 
the 
optimal 
mapping 
between 
the 
supply 
and 
demand 
of 
labor 
markets, 
and 
significantly 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
matching 
for 
platforms 
(Cameron, 
2020; 
Kitchin, 
2017). 
For 
example, 
Uber’s 
machine 
learning-driven 
matching 
technology 
takes 
into 
account 
a 
massive 
number 
of 
features 
from 
data, 
including 
distance, 
time, 
tra 
c, 
and 
a 
diverse 
set 
of 
other 
real-world 
dynamics, 
and 
produce 
millions 
of 
best-match 
pair 
predictions 
per 
minute 
(Turakhia, 
2017). 
Matching 
enhancement 
driven 
by 
advanced 
algorithms 
is 
also 
pervasive 
beyond 
the 
ride-hailing 
platform. 
Deliveroo, 
an 
online 
food 
delivery 
platform, 
adopts 
machine 
learning 
algorithms 
trained 
on 
historical 
matching 
records 
in 
its 
dispatch 
engine. 
It 
is 
able 
to 
predict 
the 
best 
possible 
match 
between 
gig 
riders 
and 
customer 
orders 
in 
real 
time 
(Sen, 
2021). 
Instacart, 
a 
platform 
o 
ering 
grocery 
delivery 
service, 
designs 
machine 
learning-based 
matching 
algorithms 
to 
enhance 
the 
quality 
of 
service, 
and 
its 
algorithm 
can 
optimally 
balance 
the 
number 
of 
shoppers 
with 
customer 
demand 
for 
groceries 
(Mixson, 
2021). 
Overall, 
matching 
quality 
can 
be 
improved 
by 
leveraging 
technologies’ 
capability 
to 
process 
the 
sheer 
volume 
of 
information 
about 
the 
dynamics 
of 
supply 
and 
demand 
of 
workers 
and 
their 
activities. 
Accordingly, 
the 
matching 
outcomes 
from 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
can 
well 
reflect 
the 
market 
conditions 
of 
labor. 


In 
practice, 
the 
human-technology 
co-operation 
mode 
in 
which 
human 
workers 
are 
downstream 
of 
the 
technology’s 
output 
takes 
place 
frequently 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms: 
advances 
in 
matching 
technologies 
engage 
in 
managerial 
activities 
such 
as 
allocating 
job 
tasks 
for 
human 
workers 
to 
perform 
(Lee 
et 
al., 
2015; 
Bai 
et 
al., 
2020; 
Bundorf 
et 
al., 
2019). 
A 
worker 
in 
theory 
should 
receive 
the 
best 
employer 
through 
technologies 
with 
high 
quality 
matching, 
which 
can 
help 
that 
worker 
raise 
earnings 
and 
platform 
gain 
a 
higher 
revenue 
(Cramer 
and 
Krueger, 
2016). 
Nevertheless, 
the 
improved 
matching 
outcome 
can 
convey 
demand 
information 
and 
thus 
a 
ect 
human 
workers’ 
decisions, 
such 
as 
whether 
to 
participate 
on 
the 
gig-economy 
platform. 
Specifically, 
the 
participation 
of 
a 
matching 
technology 
in 
human 
decisions 
involves 
the 
matching 
outcome 
serving 
as 
an 
input 
for 
a 
human 
decision-maker 
to 
make 
decisions 
about 
choosing 
an 
action 
to 
maximize 
expected 
payo 
s 
(Agrawal 
et 
al., 
2018; 
Boyaci 
et 
al., 
2020). 
Advances 
in 
matching 
technologies 
can 
enable 
matched 
outcomes 
to 
provide 
a 
more 
accurate 
signal 
of 
labor 
market 
conditions 
to 
workers, 
allowing 
them 
to 
compare 
the 
expected 
costs 
and 
benefits 
for 
making 
optimal 
participation 
decisions 
more 
precisely. 
However, 
there 
is 
a 
scarcity 
of 
research 
that 
systematically 
studies 
the 
impact 
of 
advances 
in 
matching 
technologies 
on 
the 


7 





participation 
behavior 
of 
gig 
workers, 
its 
strategic 
implications, 
and 
possible 
unintended 
consequences 
that 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
may 
have 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms.4 
Our 
study 
aims 
to 
fill 
the 
gap 
in 
the 
literature 
by 
explicitly 
examining 
the 
potential 
negative 
consequences 
of 
a 
better 
matching 
for 
a 
platform 
because 
of 
the 
induced 
workers’ 
strategic 
participation 
behavior. 


In 
line 
with 
the 
role 
that 
technologies 
play 
in 
the 
human 
decision-making 
process, 
a 
growing 
stream 
of 
research 
examines 
algorithmic 
management 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms, 
which 
refers 
to 
the 
practice 
of 
using 
algorithms 
to 
guide 
incentives 
and 
make 
recommendations 
to 
platform 
workers 
about 
the 
actions 
they 
may 
take 
(Tambe 
et 
al., 
2019). 
The 
studies 
in 
this 
literature 
provide 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
narrative 
anecdotes, 
investigating 
the 
influence 
that 
algorithmic 
management 
can 
have 
on 
workers’ 
behavior 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms 
(Kellogg 
et 
al., 
2020; 
Möhlmann 
and 
Zalmanson, 
2017; 
Rosenblat 
and 
Stark, 
2016; 
Wood 
et 
al., 
2019). 
As 
algorithmic 
technologies 
are 
increasingly 
improved 
and 
used 
to 
enhance 
the 
competency 
of 
platform 
operations, 
especially 
the 
process 
of 
matching 
workers 
and 
employers, 
a 
systematic 
framework 
is 
needed 
to 
understand 
the 
impact 
of 
such 
matching 
technologies 
and 
implications 
for 
these 
platforms, 
hence 
the 
focus 
of 
our 
study. 
Furthermore, 
a 
growing 
body 
of 
studies 
on 
algorithmic 
management 
discuss 
the 
notion 
of 
“algorithmic 
imaginary” 
of 
gig 
workers 
in 
practice 
(Zhang 
et 
al., 
2022). 
Algorithmic 
imaginary 
is 
defined 
as 
“ways 
of 
thinking 
about 
what 
algorithms 
are, 
what 
they 
should 
be, 
and 
how 
they 
function” 
(Bucher, 
2017). 
As 
the 
quality 
of 
matching 
can 
be 
improved 
through 
advances 
in 
algorithms, 
we 
use 
algorithmic 
imaginary 
as 
a 
lens 
to 
understand 
how 
gig 
workers 
perceive 
matching 
technologies 
enabled 
by 
algorithms, 
make 
sense 
of 
information 
from 
the 
matches, 
and 
make 
strategic 
decisions, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
central 
to 
platforms 
moving 
forward 
in 
the 
gig 
economy.

Main 
Model 


3.1 
Model 
Setup 
We 
consider 
a 
gig-economy 
platform 
with 
employers 
(he/him/his) 
requesting 
and 
workers 
(she/her/hers) 
taking 
job 
tasks. 
When 
an 
employer’s 
job 
task 
has 
a 
good 
match 
with 
a 
worker, 
the 
generated 
revenue 
is 
xH 
if 
the 
worker 
takes 
the 
job. 
When 
an 
employer’s 
job 
task 
is 
a 
poor 
match 
with 
a 
worker, 
the 
generated 
revenue 
is 
xL 
if 
the 
worker 
takes 
it, 
where 
0 
<xL 
<xH 
. 
Taking 
a 
ride-hailing 
or 
a 
food-delivering 
platform 
(e.g., 
Uber 
and 
Deliveroo) 
as 
an 
example, 
the 
objective 
of 
optimally 
matching 


4From 
the 
IS 
literature, 
Zhang 
et 
al. 
(2020) 
provide 
empirical 
evidence 
that 
drivers 
update 
their 
beliefs 
and 
infer 
demand 
based 
on 
the 
information 
observed 
on 
the 
platform 
to 
make 
driving 
decisions. 
The 
beliefs 
of 
platform 
users 
can 
also 
be 
updated 
based 
on 
information 
signals 
driven 
by 
AI 
or 
algorithms 
more 
broadly. 
For 
example, 
Fu 
et 
al. 
(2022) 
empirically 
examine 
the 
Zillow 
platform 
and 
find 
that 
Zillow’s 
Zestimate, 
as 
an 
AI-driven 
estimate 
of 
the 
property’s 
market 
value, 
oers 
a 
signal 
of 
the 
true 
property 
value 
and 
influences 
the 
beliefs 
of 
both 
buyers 
and 
sellers. 
Our 
model 
is 
built 
on 
a 
combination 
of 
the 
conditions 
in 
which 
1) 
workers 
infer 
demand 
based 
on 
the 
information 
on 
a 
platform, 
and 
2) 
the 
information 
can 
be 
provided 
by 
technologies 
that 
are 
enabled 
by 
AI 
or 
algorithms 
more 
broadly.

a 
driver 
(worker) 
and 
a 
rider 
or 
customer 
(employer) 
is 
to 
achieve 
lower 
wait 
time 
for 
the 
rider 
or 
customer 
and 
more 
revenue 
for 
the 
driver. 
It 
should 
take 
a 
good-match 
driver 
less 
time 
to 
pick 
up 
a 
given 
rider 
and 
send 
him 
to 
the 
destination, 
or 
to 
pick 
up 
food 
and 
deliver 
it 
to 
a 
given 
customer, 
thus 
generating 
a 
higher 
revenue 
per 
unit 
time. 


In 
our 
main 
model, 
we 
assume 
that 
workers 
work 
independently. 
This 
assumption 
precludes 
the 
role 
of 
competition 
between 
workers 
and 
allows 
us 
first 
to 
introduce 
the 
key 
mechanism 
and 
driving 
forces 
clearly. 
We 
will 
further 
relax 
this 
assumption 
in 
an 
extended 
model 
in 
which 
we 
consider 
competition 
among 
workers. 
Under 
this 
assumption, 
without 
loss 
of 
generality, 
we 
consider 
a 
representative 
worker 
and 
two 
potential 
representative 
employers, 
one 
with 
a 
good 
match 
and 
the 
other 
with 
a 
poor 
match.5 
Each 
employer 
appears 
with 
a 
probability 
p, 
where 
a 
higher 
p 
indicates 
a 
higher 
labor 
demand 
on 
the 
platform.6 
This 
fluctuation 
of 
labor 
demand 
reflects 
demand 
uncertainty 
in 
real 
life. 
In 
our 
Uber 
example, 
each 
rider 
(employer) 
may 
come 
to 
the 
platform 
with 
some 
probability. 
When 
there 
is 
a 
higher 
demand 
for 
Uber 
service 
(e.g., 
after 
a 
social 
event 
or 
a 
gathering), 
such 
probability 
p 
will 
be 
higher. 
The 
worker 
does 
not 
know 
the 
exact 
value 
of 
p. 


The 
platform 
assigns 
the 
worker 
to 
an 
available 
employer 
who 
appears 
on 
the 
platform. 
We 
consider 
two 
scenarios 
in 
this 
job 
assignment 
procedure: 
(1) 
no 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
used, 
and 
(2) 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
applied. 
In 
the 
first 
case 
without 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
the 
worker 
is 
randomly 
assigned 
to 
an 
available 
employer; 
that 
is, 
the 
platform 
cannot 
take 
matching 
quality 
into 
consideration 
because 
it 
is 
technologically 
incapable 
or 
lacks 
enough 
historical 
data 
to 
identify 
the 
match 
between 
each 
employer 
and 
a 
given 
worker. 
Specifically, 
if 
both 
employers 
appear 
on 
the 
platform, 
then 
the 
worker 
is 
assigned 
to 
each 
employer 
(xH 
, 
xL) 
with 
equal 
probability 


1 


2; 
if 
only 
one 
employer 
appears 
on 
the 
platform, 
then 
the 
worker 
is 
automatically 
assigned 
to 
the 
employer; 
if 
no 
employer 
appears, 
then 
no 
job 
is 
available, 
and 
thus 
zero 
revenue 
is 
generated. 
In 
the 
second 
case 
with 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
the 
platform 
is 
able 
to 
identify 
the 
match 
between 
each 
employer 
and 
the 
worker 
and 
always 
assigns 
the 
worker 
to 
the 
better-match 
employer 
who 
appears 
on 
the 
platform 
to 
maximize 
its 
revenue. 
This 
is 
essentially 
how 
advanced 
matching 
technologies 
such 
as 
AI-driven 
algorithms 
nowadays 
manage 
matching 
for 
platforms 
and 
help 
firms 
make 
more 
informed 
decisions. 
Specifically, 
if 
both 
employers 
appear 
on 
the 
platform, 
then 
the 
worker 
is 
assigned 
to 
the 
good-match 
employer 
(xH 
) 
with 
probability 
1; 
otherwise, 
the 
assignment 
happens 
to 
be 
the 
same 
as 
that 
in 
the 
no 
advanced 
technology 
case 
since 
only 
one 
or 
no 
employer 
appears, 
and 
thus 
matching 
is 
pre-determined. 
Here, 
we 
focus 
on 
the 
two 
extreme 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
platform 


5The 
results 
are 
not 
qualitatively 
changed 
for 
a 
model 
with 
more 
than 
two 
employers. 


6The 
parameter 
p 
essentially 
represents 
the 
relative 
demand 
to 
supply. 
Because 
we 
consider 
the 
simple 
case 
in 
the 
main 
model 
for 
which 
demand 
conditions 
for 
workers 
are 
independent, 
p 
eectively 
captures 
the 
demand 
condition 
for 
a 
specific 
worker. 
When 
we 
consider 
the 
situation 
in 
which 
worker 
demand 
conditions 
are 
interrelated 
in 
the 
model 
extension 
in 
Section 
4.5, 
a 
small 
(large) 
p 
suggests 
that 
the 
relative 
demand 
to 
supply 
is 
low 
(high). 
In 
that 
model 
extension, 
a 
match 
is 
determined 
by 
both 
demand 
and 
supply 
conditions.

either 
cannot 
identify 
or 
can 
perfectly 
identify 
the 
match 
for 
the 
easy 
exposition 
of 
the 
mechanisms 
at 
play. 
We 
will 
then 
examine 
the 
case 
in 
which 
the 
platform 
can 
identify 
the 
match 
with 
only 
a 
certain 
probability 
in 
the 
model 
extension 
in 
Section 
4.3. 


We 
consider 
the 
context 
in 
which 
there 
is 
demand 
stickiness 
over 
time. 
For 
example, 
in 
ride-sharing 
and 
food-delivering 
markets, 
demand 
is 
typically 
stable 
within 
a 
short 
period 
of 
time. 
To 
capture 
this 
stability, 
we 
consider 
a 
two-period 
model 
and 
assume 
that 
the 
labor 
demand 
probability 
p 
stays 
the 
same 
in 
both 
periods.7 
We 
use 
x1 
and 
x2 
to 
denote 
the 
job 
assigned 
to 
the 
worker 
in 
the 
first 
and 
second 
periods, 
respectively, 
which 
also 
represent 
revenue 
in 
the 
two 
periods. 
The 
platform 
and 
the 
worker 
split 
the 
revenue 
so 
that 
the 
worker 
takes 
a 
” 
proportion 
of 
the 
revenue. 
That 
is, 
the 
platform 
takes 
1≠ 
” 
proportion 
of 
the 
generated 
revenue 
as 
a 
commission 
fee. 
In 
the 
first 
period, 
the 
worker 
participates 
on 
the 
platform 
and 
is 
assigned 
to 
an 
available 
employer 
by 
the 
platform. 
The 
worker 
works 
on 
the 
assigned 
job, 
obtains 
the 
revenue 
from 
the 
job, 
and 
thus 
observes 
the 
match 
between 
herself 
and 
the 
assigned 
employer: 
high 
(x1 
=xH 
), 
low 
(x1 
=xL), 
or 
no 
job 
assigned 
(x1 
=0). 


The 
worker 
will 
then 
infer 
the 
labor 
demand 
based 
on 
what 
she 
obtains 
in 
the 
first 
period 
and 
her 
knowledge 
of 
the 
matching 
procedure 
used 
by 
the 
platform 
(i.e., 
whether 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
utilized), 
and 
then 
update 
her 
belief 
on 
p 
in 
a 
Bayesian 
manner. 
We 
assume 
that 
the 
prior 
of 
p 
follows 
a 
uniform 
distribution 
between 
0 
and 
1. 
The 
likelihoods 
of 
a 
worker 
being 
assigned 
to 
a 
good-match 
employer 
(x1 
=xH 
), 
a 
poor-match 
employer 
(x1 
=xL), 
and 
no 
employer 
(x1 
=0) 
are 
given 
below 
in 
equations 
(1) 
and 
(2) 
for 
the 
cases 
without 
and 
with 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
respectively. 
Since 
the 
technology 
remains 
the 
same 
across 
two 
periods, 
such 
likelihoods 
also 
apply 
to 
the 
second 
period 
(x2). 
Throughout 
our 
paper, 
we 
use 
superscript 
“0” 
to 
indicate 
the 
case 
without 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
and 
use 
superscript 
“T” 
to 
indicate 
the 
case 
with 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology. 
When 
no 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted, 
the 
likelihoods 
are: 


Y

_Pr0(x1

[Pr0(x1 
=0|p)=Pr0(x2

. 


When 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
applied, 
the 
likelihoods 
are: 


Y 


_ 


_ 


_ 
PrT 
(x1

|p)=PrT 
(x2

_ 


_ 


_

[PrT 
(x1 
=0|p)=PrT 
(x2 
=0|p)=(1≠ 
p)2 
. 


7Even 
if 
the 
demand 
probability 
p 
changes 
across 
periods, 
as 
long 
as 
there 
is 
a 
strong 
correlation 
between 
periods, 
our 
results 
hold 
qualitatively.

Based 
on 
these 
likelihoods 
and 
the 
distribution 
of 
the 
prior 
(U[0,1]), 
we 
calculate 
the 
Bayesian 
posterior

the

probability 
as

From 
equations 
(3) 
and 
(4), 
we 
make 
the 
following 
observations. 
First, 
when 
no 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
applied 
in 
job 
assignments, 
the 
worker 
will 
make 
the 
same 
inference 
on 
pas 
long 
as 
there 
is 
non-zero 
demand. 
That 
is, 
receiving 
either 
xH 
or 
xL 
in 
the 
first 
period 
updates 
the 
worker’s 
belief 
on 
pin 
the 
same 
way 
(i.e., 
f0(p|x1 
= 
xL)= 
f0(p|x1 
= 
xH 
)). 
This 
di 
ers 
from 
the 
case 
in 
which 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
used 
because 
with 
the 
advanced 
technology, 
an 
assigned 
job 
carries 
additional 
information. 
For 
example, 
if 
the 
worker 
is 
assigned 
to 
a 
poor-match 
employer 
by 
an 
advanced 
matching 
algorithm, 
then 
she 
will 
know 
that 
only 
one 
employer 
appears, 
because 
otherwise 
the 
matching 
algorithm 
would 
have 
assigned 
a 
good-match 
employer 
to 
her. 
This 
implies 
a 
lower 
demand 
probability 
pthan 
when 
the 
worker 
is 
assigned 
to 
a 
good-match 
employer 
in 
the 
first 
period. 
Therefore, 
the 
posterior 
belief 
on 
the 
demand 
probability 
pplaces 
lower 
weights 
on 
larger 
values 
of 
pwhen 
x1 
= 
xL 
than 
when 
x1 
= 
xH 
(i.e., 
fT 
(p|x1 
= 
xL) 
<fT 
(p|x1 
= 
xH 
) 
for 
p>32). 
Second, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
used, 
the 
posterior 
of 
pgiven 
x1 
=0 
is 
identical 
(i.e., 
f0(p|x1 
= 
0) 
= 
fT 
(p|x1 
= 
0)). 
This 
is 
because 
the 
labor 
demand 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
platform’s 
matching 
method, 
and 
the 
technology 
plays 
no 
role 
in 
matching 
when 
there 
is 
no 
employer 
available 
on 
the 
platform. 


Now 
that 
the 
worker 
updates 
her 
belief 
on 
the 
demand 
probability, 
she 
will 
decide 
in 
the 
second 
period 
whether 
to 
continue 
participating 
on 
the 
gig-economy 
platform 
based 
on 
this 
posterior 
belief 
on 


p. 
If 
the 
worker 
decides 
to 
stay 
on 
the 
platform 
in 
the 
second 
period, 
there 
will 
be 
some 
opportunity

8We 
normalize 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
in 
the 
first 
period 
to 
zero 
to 
reflect 
that 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
typically 
increases 
over 
time 
for 
gig 
workers. 
Job 
tasks 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms 
are 
generally 
short-term 
work 
and 
temporary 
projects 
(Allon 
et 
al., 
2018). 
Most 
gig 
workers 
do 
them 
on 
the 
side, 
rather 
than 
pursue 
them 
as 
their 
primary 
way 
of 
earning 
a 
living 
(Anderson 
et 
al., 
2021; 
Mccabe, 
2015). 
They 
typically 
have 
other 
full-time 
or 
part-time 
jobs, 
thus 
facing 
a 
more 
significant 
time 
commitment 
and 
opportunity 
cost 
as 
their 
work 
hours 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms 
increase. 
We 
have 
also 
considered 
the 
case 
in 
which 
a 
worker 
also 
faces 
an 
opportunity 
cost 
in 
the 
first 
period 
in 
Section 
4.2, 
and 
our 
main 
results 
hold 
qualitatively.

Given 
any 
opportunity 
cost 
c, 
a 
worker’s 
participation 
decision 
depends 
on 
the 
job 
assigned 
in 
the 
first 
period 
(x1). 
For 
example, 
a 
worker 
may 
decide 
to 
continue 
participating 
in 
the 
second 
period 
if 
x1 
is 
xH 
or 
xL 
but 
choose 
not 
to 
continue 
if 
x1 
is 
0. 
We 
denote 
the 
set 
of 
all 
first-period 
assignments 
that 
make 
the 
worker 
willing 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
second 
period 
as 
X 
par. 
Then, 
in 
this 
example, 
X 
par 
= 
{xH 
,xL}. 
In 
the 
following 
discussion, 
we 
add 
superscripts 
“0” 
and 
“T”to 
X 
par 
(i.e., 
use 
X 
0,par 
and 
X 
T,par), 
to 
denote 
this 
set 
for 
the 
case 
without 
and 
with 
the 
adoption 
of 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
respectively. 
By 
comparing 
X 
0,par 
and 
X 
T,par, 
we 
observe 
that 
using 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
can 
completely 
change 
the 
expected 
revenue 
in 
the 
second 
period; 
thus, 
the 
participation 
decision 
of 
the 
worker 
changes 
as 
well.

not

provides 
the 
conditions 
for 
the

participate

also 
asserts 
that 
while 
the

in 
general 
has 
a 
higher 
incentive 
to 
participate 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted 
because 
of 
its 
improved 
matching 
quality, 
the 
opposite 
can 
be 
true 
when 
the 
outside 
opportunity 
cost 
cis 
intermediate 
and 
the 
revenues 
of 
di 
erent 
types 
of 
matches 
(good 
or 
poor) 
are 
close 
to 
each 
other.

0,par

In 
this 
case, 
X 
T,par 
, 
which 
implies 
that 
the 
use 
of 
an 
advanced 
matching 
algorithm 
may 
undermine 
worker 
participation 
by 
revealing 
extra 
information 
in 
the 
technology-facilitated 
matching 
outcomes. 
Without 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
the 
worker 
has 
limited 
information 
over 
the 
demand 
probability. 
She 
will 
choose 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
second 
period 
as 
long 
as 
an 
employer 
is 
matched, 
either 
as 
a 
good-match 
or 
a 
poor-match. 
However, 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
used, 
a 
good 
match 
and 
a 
poor 
match 
can 
carry 
di 
erent 
information 
on 
the 
underlying 
demand 
probability. 
For 
example, 
if 
the 
worker 
is 
assigned 
to 
a 
poor-match 
employer, 
then 
she 
will 
infer 
that 
the 
underlying 
demand 
probability 
is 
low; 
otherwise, 
the 
platform 
would 
have 
assigned 
her 
to 
a 
good-
match 
employer. 
In 
this 
case, 
she 
may 
leave 
the 
platform 
and 
take 
other 
opportunities 
in 
the 
second 
period, 
which 
will 
result 
in 
an 
expected 
revenue 
loss 
for 
the 
platform. 
This 
phenomenon 
is 
more 
prominent 
when 
good-match 
and 
poor-match 
job 
tasks 
do 
not 
di 
er 
significantly 
in 
value 
(xH 
<2xL), 
such 
that 
the 
gain 
from 
a 
better 
match 
enabled 
by 
the 
technology 
will 
not 
dominate 
the 
expected 
loss, 
due 
to 
information 
revelation 
caused 
by 
the 
better 
matching 
technology. 
In 
addition, 
this 
extra

cases

Otherwise,

higher 
or 
equal

Proposition 
1 
asserts 
that 
the

expected 
revenue 
can 
be 
negatively 
a 
ected 
by 
the 
use 
of 
an 
advanced

technology, 
even 
if 
we 
do 
not 
consider 
any 
cost 
associated 
with 
developing 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology.10 
Specifically, 
when 
the 
outside 
opportunity 
cost 
for 
a 
worker 
is 
intermediate 
and 
the 
values 
of 
di 
erent 
types 
of 
match 
are 
su 
ciently 
close, 
then 
adopting 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
will 
hurt 
the 
gig-economy 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue, 
as 
illustrated 
in 
Figure 
3. 


The 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue 
is 
a 
ected 
by 
the 
use 
of 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
in 
two 
ways. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
use 
of 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
can 
enhance 
the 
matching 
quality 


10In 
our 
model, 
we 
can 
introduce 
a 
new 
parameter 
› 
oe 
[0, 
1] 
as 
the 
probability 
of 
a 
worker 
acting 
strategically 
to 
capture 
the 
scenario 
in 
which 
some 
workers 
may 
not 
act 
strategically 
and 
always 
participate 
in 
the 
second 
period, 
regardless 
of 
what 
they 
observe 
in 
the 
first 
period. 
With 
this 
new 
parameter, 
the 
condition 
for 
xH 
in 
Proposition 
1 
changes 
to 
xH 
< 
20+› 
xL. 
This 
condition 
does 
not 
shrink 
to 
an 
empty 
set 
as 
long 
as 
› 
> 
0. 
In 
practice, 
we 
believe 
at 
least 
some 


20≠6› 


workers 
act 
strategically 
(Cook 
et 
al., 
2021). 
Thus, 
our 
results 
hold 
qualitatively. 


17 





when 
employers 
with 
di 
erent 
degrees 
of 
matching 
quality 
are 
present, 
yielding 
a 
higher 
expected 
revenue. 
We 
call 
this 
e 
ect 
the 
“matching 
enhancement 
eect” 
of 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
strategic 
gig 
workers 
can 
potentially 
make 
use 
of 
the 
demand 
information 
revealed 
by 
assigned 
jobs 
in 
the 
first 
period, 
thereby 
changing 
their 
participation 
behavior. 
Specifically, 
as 
shown 
in 
Lemma 
1, 
under 
certain 
conditions, 
the 
adoption 
of 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
may 
undermine 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
worker 
compared 
to 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
not 
adopted, 
leading 
to 
a 
potential 
expected 
revenue 
loss 
for 
the 
platform. 
We 
call 
this 
e 
ect 
the 
“information 
revelation 
eect” 
of 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology. 
The 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
is, 
of 
course, 
not 
always 
detrimental 
and 
sometimes 
can 
work 
to 
the 
platform’s 
benefit 
(e.g., 
when 
a 
good-match 
employer 
is 
assigned, 
indicating 
a 
strong 
demand 
condition). 
The 
overall 
impact 
of 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
on 
the 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue 
is 
thus 
non-trivial 
and 
determined 
by 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
and, 
when 
it 
is 
negative, 
the 
relative 
strength 
of 
the 
two 
e 
ects. 
When 
the 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
is 
positive 
or 
when 
it 
is 
negative 
but 
dominated 
by 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect, 
the 
technology 
is 
instrumental 
to 
the 
gig-economy 
platform 
enabling 
better 
matching, 
which 
translates 
to 
higher 
revenue. 
When 
the 
opposite 
is 
true, 
however, 
the 
gig-economy 
platform’s 
revenue 
could 
be 
lessened 
by 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
advanced 
technology 
in 
matching 
as 
a 
result 
of 
an 
insu 
cient 
labor 
supply, 
even 
if 
we 
set 
aside 
the 
cost 
of 
developing 
and 
deploying 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology. 


Our 
model 
thus 
uncovers 
an 
important 
yet 
often-overlooked 
insight 
on 
how 
the 
revenue 
of 
a 
gig-
economy 
platform 
that 
adopts 
a 
better 
technology 
to 
facilitate 
matching 
can 
be 
a 
ected 
by 
gig 
workers’ 
strategic 
reaction 
to 
demand 
information 
revealed 
by 
assigned 
job 
tasks. 
Our 
findings 
suggest 
that 
although 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
e 
ectively 
assigns 
best-match 
job 
tasks 
to 
gig 
workers, 
a 
better 
matching 
between 
gig 
workers 
and 
job 
tasks 
may 
not 
necessarily 
lead 
to 
higher 
revenue 
for 
the 
gig-economy 
platform, 
if 
it 
further 
takes 
into 
account 
workers’ 
strategic 
participation 
behavior. 
Specifically, 
this 
strategic 
participation 
behavior 
hurts 
the 
platform 
when 
a 
poor-match 
employer 
is 
assigned 
in 
the 
first 
period. 
In 
this 
case, 
workers’ 
participation 
incentives 
are 
lower 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
used 
than 
when 
the 
technology 
is 
not 
used. 
The 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
here 
functions 
like 
an 
attribution 
e 
ect 
from 
the 
workers’ 
point 
of 
view: 
when 
a 
worker 
is 
assigned 
to 
a 
poor-match 
employer, 
she 
can 
attribute 
that 
match 
to 
either 
low 
demand 
or 
a 
poor 
matching 
system, 
until 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
e 
ectively 
rules 
out 
the 
latter. 
That 
is, 
after 
receiving 
a 
poor-match 
employer, 
a 
worker 
will 
estimate 
the 
demand 
more 
positively 
in 
the 
case 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
absent 
compared 
to 
the 
case 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
used. 
Mathematically, 
this 
can 
be 
shown 
by 
comparing 
the 
cumulative 
distribution 
functions

Our 
analysis 
shows 
that 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
not 
a 
silver 
bullet, 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
better 
technology 
such 
as 
AI 
to 
facilitate 
matching 
may 
yield 
unintended 
consequences 
on 
gig 
workers’ 
participation 
decisions, 
resulting 
in 
revenue 
loss 
for 
the 
gig-economy 
platform. 
This 
result 


o 
ers 
an 
important 
insight 
for 
gig-economy 
platforms 
currently 
adopting 
or 
planning 
to 
adopt 
a 
better 
technology 
in 
their 
matching 
process. 
Ultimately, 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
current 
state 
of 
matching 
technologies 
such 
as 
AI 
is 
restricted 
to 
the 
contextual 
data 
or 
environment 
information 
that 
it 
processes 
(Lum, 
2017). 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
worker-employer 
matching 
process, 
even 
the 
best 
technology 
can 
only 
adapt 
to 
existing 
labor 
market 
information 
about 
supply 
and 
demand. 
That 
is, 
any 
matching 
technology 
can 
only 
take 
what 
is 
given 
but 
cannot 
change 
demand 
conditions. 
In 
terms 
of 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
the 
best 
recommendation 
of 
an 
employer 
for 
each 
worker, 
conditional 
on 
contextual 
labor 
demand 
information, 
is 
delivered. 
When 
labor 
demand 
is 
low, 
even 
the 
best 
match 
may 
still 
be 
a 
poor 
match 
and 
cannot 
generate 
high 
revenue 
for 
the 
worker 
and 
platform. 
This 
unavoidably 
reveals 
additional 
information 
about 
demand, 
which 
can 
unintentionally 
discourage 
workers 
from 
continual 
participation 
because 
of 
the 
notable 
flexibility 
o 
ered 
by 
gig-economy 
platforms 
(Chen 
et 
al., 
2019). 
Workers 
may 
not 
respond 
adaptively, 
and 
can 
choose 
to 
make 
future 
participation 
decisions 
based 
on 
received 
algorithm-assigned 
employers 
(Cameron, 
2020;

et

adjust

s 
from 
continual 
participation, 
and 
strategically 
decide 
whether

While 
workers 
can 
also 
make 
strategic 
participation 
decisions 
when 
an 
advanced

technology 
is 
not 
used, 
the 
reassurance 
of 
the 
matching 
quality 
enabled 
by 
the 
advanced 
technology 
makes 
it 
more 
likely 
that 
workers 
will 
associate 
a 
poor 
match 
with 
low 
demand 
(rather 
than 
matching 
quality) 
and 
consequently 
stop 
participating. 


4 
Extended 
Models 


In 
this 
section, 
we 
conduct 
several 
model 
extensions 
to 
examine 
the 
robustness 
of 
our 
main 
result 
and 
derive 
additional 
insights 
with 
respect 
to 
adopting 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology. 
Specifically, 
we 
extend 
our 
main 
model 
to 
cases 
in 
which 
(1) 
the 
platform 
can 
strategically 
adjust 
its 
commission 
rate 
based 
on 
whether 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted, 
(2) 
a 
worker’s 
opportunity 
cost 
is 
considered 
in 
the 
first 
period, 
(3) 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
can 
identify 
the 
match 
(good 
or 
poor) 
accurately 
with 
some 
probability, 
(4) 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
workers 
is 
endogenously 
determined 
by 
competition 
between 
platforms, 
and 
(5) 
the 
workers 
compete 
for 
job 
tasks. 


4.1 
Endogenous 
Revenue 
Sharing 
In 
the 
main 
model, 
we 
consider 
a 
fixed 
commission 
rate 
(i.e., 
1≠”) 
regardless 
of 
whether 
the 
advanced 
technology 
is 
used 
for 
matching. 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
investigate 
whether 
our 
key 
insights 
are 
robust 
if 
the 
platform 
can 
strategically 
tailor 
its 
commission 
rate 
according 
to 
its 
technology 
strategy. 
That 
is, 
given 
the 
matching 
technology 
applied, 
the 
platform 
can 
choose 
a 
di 
erent 
commission 
rate. 
Consistent 
with 
the 
business 
reality 
that 
the 
commission 
rate 
is 
typically 
set 
just 
once 
for 
all 
transactions, 
we 
assume 
that 
this 
commission 
rate 
1 
≠ 
” 
(or 
equivalently, 
the 
revenue-sharing 
ratio 
with 
a 
” 
proportion 
for 
the 
worker) 
is 
decided 
at 
the 
very 
beginning 
before 
demand 
is 
realized 
and 
remains 
the 
same 
in 
both 
periods. 


Let 
”0ú 
and 
”T 
ú 
denote 
the 
optimal 
revenue-sharing 
ratio 
decided 
by 
the 
platform 
for 
the 
cases 
without 
and 
with 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
respectively.

Figure 
5 
illustrates 
the 
optimal 
revenue 
sharing 
ratio 
and 
the 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue 
described 
in 
Lemma 
2. 
This 
lemma 
implies 
that 
when 
the 
platform 
sets 
the 
commission 
rate 
based 
on 
whether 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted, 
the 
worker 
might 
in 
fact 
get 
a 
larger 
proportion 
out 
of 
the 
total 
revenue 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted 
compared 
to 
when 
it 
is 
not 
(see 
Figure 
5a). 
Conventional 
wisdom 
may 
suggest 
that, 
by 
using 
a 
better 
matching 
technology, 
the 
platform 
has 
more 
control 
over 
demand 
allocation 
and 
thus 
should 
have 
more 
bargaining 
power 
when 
setting 
commission 
rates, 
leading 
to 
a 
smaller 
” 
or 
more 
severe 
“labor 
exploitation” 
from 
workers. 
In 
contrast, 
we 
find 
that 
because 
the 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
of 
technology 
may 
undermine 
worker 
participation, 
the 
platform 
may 
have 
to 
increase 
the 
worker’s 
share 
of 
revenue 
instead 
to 
motivate 


21 





worker 
participation 
(i.e., 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
”0ú 
< 
”T 
ú). 
Accordingly, 
the 
application 
of 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
may 
not 
necessarily 
lead 
to 
more 
severe 
exploitation 
as 
expected. 


Figure 
5b 
also 
implies 
that 
under 
some 
circumstances, 
adopting 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
may 
still 
hurt 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
even 
when 
the 
revenue-sharing 
ratio 
is 
determined 
conditionally 
based 
on 
the 
use 
of 
matching 
technology. 
Proposition 
2 
gives 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
investigation 
of 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
this 
phenomenon 
happens. 


Proposition 
2. 
Even 
if 
the 
platform 
can 
choose 
the 
worker’s 
share 
of 
revenue 
based 
on 
the 
use 
of 
matching 
technology, 
when 
xH 
is 
not 
too 
large 
compared 
to 
xL 
and 
c 
is 
in 
an 
intermediary 
range 
(as 
illustrated 
in 
Figure 
6), 
the 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue 
is 
lower 
when 
it 
adopts 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
than 
when 
it 
does 
not 
(i.e., 
fiT 
ú

Comparing 
Propositions 
1 
and 
2, 
we 
can 
see 
that 
even 
when 
the 
gig-economy 
platform’s 
revenue 
sharing 
is 
strategic, 
the 
structural 
property 
with 
respect 
to 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology’s 
influence 
on 
the 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue 
remains 
intact. 
That 
is, 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
advanced 
technology 
in 
matching 
might 
hurt 
the 
gig-economy 
platform 
when 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
lies 
in 
an 
intermediate 
range 
and 
the 
di 
erence 
in 
values 
of 
di 
erent 
types 
of 
match 
is 
su 
ciently 
small. 
The 
two 
e 
ects 
of 
technology 
adoption, 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect 
and 
information 
revelation 
e 
ects, 
play 
similar 
roles. 
Even 
if 
the 
platform 
has 
enough 
market 
power 
to 
adjust 
its 
revenue 
split 
with 
the 


22 





worker, 
applying 
a 
better 
technology 
to 
matching 
may 
still 
lead 
to 
lower 
expected 
revenue 
for 
the 
platform, 
even 
if 
we 
do 
not 
need 
to 
consider 
the 
cost 
of 
applying 
the 
technology. 


4.2 
Worker’s 
First-Period 
Opportunity 
Cost 
In 
the 
main 
model, 
we 
normalize 
the 
first-period 
opportunity 
cost 
to 
zero. 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
assume 
that 
a 
worker 
also 
incurs 
an 
opportunity 
cost 
—c 
in 
the 
first 
period, 
where 
— 
oe 
[0,1]. 
Parameter 


— 
captures 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
a 
worker’s 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
working 
on 
a 
gig-economy 
platform 
increases 
over 
time 
for 
the 
reasons 
discussed 
in 
Section 
3.1. 
When 
— 
=1, 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
is 
the 
same 
in 
the 
two 
periods. 
The 
worker 
evaluates 
her 
payo 
before 
the 
first 
period 
and 
decides 
whether 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
first 
period.

Based

first-period 
participation 
decision, 
we 
can 
follow 
a 
similar 
derivation 
of 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
as 
in 
our 
main 
model. 
We 
summarize 
our 
findings 
in 
the 
following 
proposition. 


Proposition 
3. 
When 
the 
worker’s 
first-period 
opportunity 
cost 
is 
—c, 
the 
parameter 
region 
of 
(xH 
,xL,c) 
such 
that 
fiT 
ú 
< 
fi0ú 
always 
exists 
for 
any 
— 
oe 
[0,1]. 
When 
— 
Æ 
65 
, 
the 
parameter 
region 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
in 
Proposition 
1. 
When 
— 
> 
65 
, 
the 
area 
of 
such 
a 
parameter 
region 
shrinks 
as 
— 
increases. 


Proposition 
3 
shows 
that 
our 
main 
result 
– 
that 
adopting 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
can 
backfire 
and 
negatively 
a 
ect 
a 
gig-economy 
platform’s 
revenue 
– 
remains 
robust, 
although 
this 
may 
happen 
in 
a 
smaller 
parameter 
region 
as 
the 
di 
erence 
in 
opportunity 
cost 
between 
the 
two 
periods 
decreases. 
The 
intuition 
behind 
the 
sometimes 
reduced 
parameter 
region 
is 
that 
when 
the 
first-period 
opportunity 
cost 
is 
higher, 
there 
are 
more 
disadvantages 
associated 
with 
avoiding 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
because 
the 
worker’s 
first-period 
participation 
constraint 
without 
the 
advanced 
technology 
is 
tighter 
than 
that 
with 
the 
technology. 
Therefore, 
a 
platform 
can 
find 
it 
harder 
to 
adopt 
a 
better 
matching 


23 





technology. 
However, 
this 
region 
never 
disappears, 
even 
if 
the 
worker’s 
first-period 
opportunity 
cost 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
in 
the 
second 
period 
(— 
=1), 
confirming 
the 
robustness 
of 
our 
main 
result. 


4.3 
Imperfect 
Matching 
Technology 
In 
our 
main 
model, 
we 
consider 
two 
extreme 
cases 
of 
matching, 
“random” 
matching 
and 
“perfect” 
matching, 
to 
illustrate 
adopting 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
can 
reduce 
a 
gig-economy 
platform’s 
revenue. 
We 
assume 
that 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted, 
as 
long 
as 
a 
good-
match 
employer 
(xH 
) 
is 
available 
in 
the 
market, 
he 
will 
be 
identified 
and 
assigned 
to 
a 
worker. 
In 
this 
extension, 
we 
relax 
this 
assumption 
and 
discuss 
the 
possibility 
of 
“imperfect” 
matching. 
To 
nest 
“random” 
and 
“perfect” 
matching 
as 
special 
cases, 
we 
introduce 
a 
new 
parameter 
k 
and 
specify 
the 
matching 
process 
as 
follows: 
when 
the 
good-match 
(xH 
) 
and 
poor-match 
(xL) 
employers 
are 
both 
available 
on 
the 
platform, 
the 
probability 
that 
xH 
is 
identified 
and 
assigned 
to 
the 
worker 
is 
12 
+ 
k, 
where 
k 
oe 
[0, 
21] 
captures 
the 
probability 
of 
the 
matching 
technology 
identifying 
and 
assigning 
the 
good 
match 
accurately. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
k 
=0 
is 
equivalent 
to 
a 
random 
matching, 
and 
k 
= 
21 
is 
equivalent 
to 
a 
perfect 
matching. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
main 
model 
compares 
the 
case 
when 
k 
=0 
to 
that 
when 
k 
= 
21 
. 
In 
what 
follows, 
we 
analyze 
the 
worker’s 
participation 
decision 
and 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
when 
adopting 
a 
matching 
technology 
with 
the 
accuracy 
parameter 
k. 
We 
are 
interested 
in 
answering 
this 
question: 
will 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
always 
increase 
as 
the 
matching 
technology 
becomes 
more 
capable 
of 
identifying 
and 
assigning 
good 
matches? 


We 
maintain 
all 
the 
other 
assumptions 
in 
our 
main 
model. 
Following 
a 
similar 
procedure 
as 
that 
in 
our 
main 
model, 
we 
can 
calculate 
the 
worker’s 
expected 
payo 
in 
the 
second 
period 
conditional 
upon 
observing 
the 
first-period 
job 
assignment, 
or 
Ek[w2|x1],where 
the 
superscript 
k 
indicates 
the 
matching 
technology 
accuracy. 
We 
argue 
that 
adopting 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
can 
backfire 
because 
a 
worker’s 
conditional 
expected 
payo 
in 
the 
second 
period 
may 
be 
lower 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
applied 
than 
when 
it 
is 
not. 
We 
note 
that 
this 
happens 
only 
when 
the 
first-period 
job 
assignment 
is 
a 
poor 
match 
(x1 
= 
xL), 
so 
we 
focus 
on 
the 
case 
when 
x1 
= 
xL 
in 
the 
following 
lemma. 


Lemma 
3. 
When 
a 
technology 
with 
matching 
accuracy 
k 
is 
adopted, 
the 
worker’s 
expected 
payo� 
in 
the 
second 
period 
upon 
receiving 
a 
poor-match 
employer 
in 
the 
first 
period 
(x1 
= 
xL) 
is 
given 
by: 


4(xH

≠

Ek[w2|x1 
=

10(1

. 
(17) 
Furthermore, 


• 
when 
xH 
Æ 
54xL, 
Ek[w2|x1 
= 
xL] 
decreases 
in 
k,and 
• 
when 
xH 
> 
45xL, 
Ek[w2|x1 
= 
xL] 
first 
increases 
and 
then 
decreases 
in 
k,with 
the 
peak 
at 
24

Lemma 
3 
indicates 
that 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
matching 
accuracy 
(i.e., 
k) 
and 
the 
worker’s 
expected 
second-period 
payo 
, 
given 
x1 
= 
xL 
(i.e., 
Ek[w2|x1 
= 
xL]), 
can 
vary 
depending 
on 
the 
relative 
magnitude 
of 
xH 
and 
xL. 
We 
have 
several 
observations 
from 
this 
lemma. 
First, 
as 
the 
matching 
technology 
becomes 
more 
accurate, 
the 
worker’s 
expected 
second-period 
payo 
does 
not 
always 
increase 
(and 
may 
even 
decrease 
in 
some 
cases). 
This 
observation 
reflects 
the 
two 
countervailing 
e 
ects 
of 
advanced 
technology 
adoption 
that 
we 
discussed 
in 
our 
main 
model: 
the 
positive 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect 
and 
the 
negative 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect. 
Because 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect 
is 
less 
significant 
when 
the 
di 
erence 
between 
xH 
and 
xL 
is 
small 
(xH 
Æ 


5 


4xL), 
there 
is 
a 
decreasing 
relationship 
between 
matching 
accuracy 
kand 
Ek[w2|x1 
= 
xL] 
in 
the 
first 
case 
of 
Lemma 
3. 
Second, 
in 
both 
cases 
of 
Lemma 
3, 
the 
e 
ect 
of 
further 
technology 
improvement 
on 
Ek[w2|x1 
= 
xL] 
is 
negative 
if 
the 
accuracy 
of 
the 
matching 
technology 
is 
already 
high. 
This 
finding 
provides 
an 
interesting 
and 
somewhat 
counter-intuitive 
insight 
into 
a 
platform’s 
technology 
strategy 
in 
that 
a 
platform 
may 
prefer 
a 
less-than-perfect 
matching 
technology, 
even 
if 
improving 
the 
technology’s 
matching 
capability 
per 
se 
is 
costless. 
This 
insight 
will 
be 
formalized 
in 
Proposition 
4. 
Third, 
if 
we 
compare 
Ek=0[w2|x1 
= 
xL] 
(random 
matching, 
or 
no 
advanced 
technology 
adoption) 
and 


Ek=

12

[w2|x1 
= 
xL] 
(perfect 
matching 
technology), 
then 
we 
return 
to 
our 
main 
model.

her

the 
second

can 
be 
very 
complicated 
as 
the 
matching 
accuracy 
becomes 
higher. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
tractability, 
we 
focus 
on 


ÓÔ 


Ek=0[w

most 
interesting 
case 
when 
coe 
(c,c),where

[w2|x1

Figure

illustrates 
this 
case, 
in 
which 
there

kÆ 
k2 
and 
Ek[w2|x1 
= 
xL] 
<cif 
k<k1 
or 
k>k2. 
In 
other 
words, 
upon 
receiving 
xL 
in 
the 
first 
period, 
the 
worker 
continues 
participating 
in 
the 
second 
period 
only 
when 
the 
matching 
technology 
is 
not 
too 
poor 
and 
not 
too 
advanced, 
which 
is 
a 
direct 
outcome 
of 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
and 
information 
revelation 
e 
ects. 
Given 
such 
worker 
participation 
behavior, 
we 
can 
derive 
the 
platform’s 
overall 
ex-ante 
expected 
revenue, 
denoted 
as 
fik 
, 
and 
discuss 
how 
it 
will 
change 
as 
the 
matching 
accuracy 
improves, 
which 
we 
summarize 
in 
the 
following 
proposition. 


Proposition 
4. 
When 
xH 
> 
54xL 
and 
c 
oe 
(c,c), 
the 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue 
fik 
obtains

k2 
<2 
if 
cÆ 
,andat 
k 
=

otherwise. 


456xH 
≠323xL 


According 
to 
Proposition 
4, 
as 
the 
accuracy 
of 
the 
matching 
technology 
increases, 
the 
platform 
will 
not 
necessarily 
benefit 
from 
this 
accuracy. 
This 
result 
echoes 
the 
findings 
in 
our 
main 
model 
in 
that 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
perfect 
matching 
technology 
can 
backfire. 
Figure 
8 
illustrates 
the 
case 
in 
which 
the 
platform’s 
maximum 
revenue 
is 
obtained 
when 
the 
matching 
accuracy 
is 
less 
than 
perfect.

the

revenue 
with 
the 
perfect 
technology 
(k=

not 
be 
as 
high 
as 
that 
when 
k=k2.

In 
addition, 
this 
analysis 
also 
sheds 
light 
on 
a 
platform’s 
optimal 
technology 
choice. 
Our 
findings 
suggest 
that 
when 
a 
platform 
makes 
decisions 
to 
improve 
its 
level 
of 
matching 
accuracy 
for 
its 
matching 
technology, 
in 
addition 
to 
development 
or 
investment 
costs, 
the 
impact 
of 
this 
added 
improvement 
on 
both 
matching 
quality 
and 
workers’ 
participation 
behavior 
needs 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account. 
While 
it 
is 
typically 
not 
wise 
to 
forego 
any 
improvement 
and 
instead 
continue 
to 
use 
random 
matching, 
the 


26 





platform 
may 
strategically 
refrain 
from 
pushing 
forward 
matching 
accuracy 
further 
even 
if 
doing 
so 
is 
cost 
free. 


4.4 
Endogenous 
Opportunity 
Cost 
from 
Platform 
Competition 
In 
our 
main 
model, 
we 
assume 
the 
worker’s 
opportunity 
cost 
to 
be 
given 
and 
exogenous. 
As 
mentioned, 
such 
opportunity 
costs 
can 
arise 
partly 
because 
a 
worker 
may 
switch 
to 
another 
competing 
platform. 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
focus 
on 
the 
role 
of 
platform 
competition 
and 
assume 
that 
the 
expected 
payo 
on 
the 
competing 
platform 
is 
an 
opportunity 
cost 
for 
a 
worker; 
as 
a 
result, 
we 
normalize 
the 
worker’s 
payo 
from 
other 
outside 
options 
to 
0. 


We 
consider 
a 
focal 
gig-economy 
platform 
(i.e., 
the 
platform 
we 
consider 
in 
our 
main 
model) 
that 
has 
an 
advantage 
(or 
disadvantage) 
over 
a 
competing 
platform. 
We 
capture 
this 
advantage 
(or 
disadvantage) 
by 
parameter 
–, 
which 
can 
be 
either 
negative 
or 
positive 
and 
is 
the 
added 
utility 
that 
a 
worker 
obtains 
when 
choosing 
the 
focal 
platform. 
The 
focal 
platform 
is 
advantaged 
if 
– 
> 
0 
and 
is 
disadvantaged 
if 
– 
< 
0. 
This 
parameter 
e 
ectively 
captures 
considerations 
beyond 
the 
payo 
from 
job 
tasks 
that 
may 
a 
ect 
a 
worker’s 
platform 
choice 
(Song 
et 
al., 
2020; 
Chen 
and 
Guo, 
2022), 
such 
as 
the 
focal 
platform’s 
reputation 
and 
service 
quality 
relative 
to 
its 
competitor. 


Similar 
to 
our 
main 
model, 
we 
consider 
a 
two-period 
game 
in 
which 
there 
is 
a 
worker 
and 
employers 
with 
potential 
job 
tasks 
on 
both 
platforms 
that 
are 
either 
a 
good 
match 
(xH 
) 
or 
a 
poor 
match 
(xL) 
for 
the 
worker. 
The 
probability 
that 
each 
employer 
appears 
is 
p 
on 
the 
focal 
platform 
and 
q 
on 
the 
competing 
platform. 
As 
in 
our 
main 
model, 
p 
and 
q 
capture 
the 
labor 
demand 
on 
the 
two 
platforms, 
respectively. 
The 
worker 
knows 
only 
the 
distribution 
of 
p 
and 
q 
and 
not 
their 
realized 
values. 
We 
also 
assume 
that 
the 
marginal 
distributions 
of 
p 
and 
q 
are 
both 
uniform 
distributions 
on 
[0, 
1]. 


In 
this 
extension, 
we 
further 
model 
the 
correlation 
between 
labor 
demands 
on 
the 
two 
platforms. 
This 
correlation 
is 
common 
knowledge 
to 
the 
platforms 
and 
the 
worker 
and 
is 
relevant 
to 
the 
worker 
when 
she 
infers 
her 
expected 
payo 
from 
her 
observation 
on 
a 
given 
platform 
in 
the 
first 
period. 
Such 
correlation, 
in 
practice, 
can 
be 
either 
positive 
or 
negative. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
two 
platforms 
can 
compete 
with 
each 
other: 
given 
the 
constant 
total 
labor 
demand, 
if 
one 
platform 
has 
many 
employers 
at 
a 
given 
time, 
then 
the 
demand 
on 
the 
other 
platform 
may 
be 
low, 
suggesting 
a 
negative 
correlation. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
some 
factors, 
such 
as 
being 
located 
in 
similar 
temporal 
and 
geographical 
regions, 
could 
lead 
to 
commonalities 
and 
thus 
a 
positive 
correlation 
between 
the 
two 
demands. 
To 
capture 
this 
correlation, 
we 
introduce 
a 
joint 
distribution 
of 
p 
and 
q 
with 
marginal 
distributions 
as 
U[0, 
1].We 
denote 
the 
CDF 
of 
this 
joint 
distribution 
as 
C(p, 
q), 
which 
is 
called 
a 
copula 
in 
statistics 
literature 
(e.g., 
Trivedi 
and 
Zimmer, 
2007; 
Jaworski 
et 
al., 
2010), 
and 
has 
the 
following 
upper 
and 
lower 
bounds 


27 





(a.k.a. 
Fréchet-Hoe 
ding 
bounds): 
max{p 
+ 
q 
≠1, 
0} 
ÆC(p, 
q) 
Æmin{p, 
q}. 


It 
is 
easy 
to 
check 
that 
the 
upper 
bound 
corresponds 
to 
the 
case 
of 
a 
perfect 
positive 
correlation 
(p 
= 
q) 
while 
the 
lower 
bound 
corresponds 
to 
the 
case 
of 
a 
perfect 
negative 
correlation 
(p 
=1≠q) 
(e.g., 
Trivedi 
and 
Zimmer, 
2007; 
Jaworski 
et 
al., 
2010). 
To 
capture 
the 
full 
range 
of 
possible 
correlations, 
we 
specify 
the 
joint 
CDF 
of 
p 
and 
q 
as: 


ÓÔ≠ 
1 


C(p, 
q) 
= 
max 
p 
≠◊ 
+ 
q 
≠◊ 
≠1, 
0 
◊ 
, 
(18) 


which 
is 
also 
known 
as 
the 
Clayton 
copula 
(e.g., 
Trivedi 
and 
Zimmer, 
2007; 
Jaworski 
et 
al., 
2010). 
A 
parameter 
◊ 
oe[≠1, 
OE)\{0} 
is 
introduced 
here. 
When 
◊ 
= 
≠1, 
we 
have 
the 
Fréchet-Hoe 
ding 
lower 
bound. 
As 
◊ 
æOE, 
the 
joint 
distribution 
approaches 
the 
Fréchet-Hoe 
ding 
upper 
bound, 
and 
as 
◊ 
æ0, 
it 
approaches 
the 
case 
of 
independent 
p 
and 
q 
(e.g., 
Schmidt, 
2007). 
In 
other 
words, 
as 
◊ 
changes 
from 
≠1 
to 
0 
and 
to 
OE, 
it 
captures 
the 
range 
from 
a 
perfect 
negative 
correlation, 
to 
independence, 
and 
to 
a 
perfect 
positive 
correlation. 


Neither 
platform 
currently 
uses 
any 
advanced 
matching 
technology. 
We 
are 
interested 
in 
studying 
whether 
the 
focal 
platform 
has 
an 
incentive 
to 
adopt 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
if 
it 
has 
a 
choice 
to 
do 
so, 
given 
the 
status 
quo. 
This 
question 
is 
essentially 
the 
same 
as 
the 
question 
we 
examine 
in 
our 
main 
model, 
except 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
competing 
platform 
in 
this 
extension. 


The 
timing 
of 
the 
game 
is 
as 
follows: 
(1) 
The 
focal 
platform 
decides 
whether 
to 
adopt 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
which 
is 
committed 
across 
both 
periods. 
(2) 
The 
worker 
then 
decides 
which 
platform 
to 
participate 
during 
the 
first 
period.11 
(3) 
The 
worker 
observes 
her 
assignment 
on 
platform 
of 
choice, 
gets 
the 
first-period 
payo 
, 
and 
then 
decides 
either 
to 
stay 
on 
the 
same 
platform 
for 
the 
second 
period 
or 
switch 
to 
the 
other 
one 
if 
she 
believes 
she 
can 
earn 
more 
by 
doing 
so. 
(4) 
The 
worker’s 
second-period 
payo 
is 
realized. 


Proposition 
5. 
When 
there 
is 
a 
competing 
platform 
and 
xH 
is 
close 
to 
xL,the 
focal 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue 
is 
lower 
when 
it 
adopts 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
than 
when 
it 
does 
not 
if 


– 
oe[0, 
–) 
and 
◊ 
oe(◊, 
◊), 
where 
– 
> 
0 
and 
◊

Proposition 
5 
provides 
several 
important 
insights. 
First, 
we 
show 
that 
the 
key 
finding 
in 
our 
main 
model 
– 
that 
adopting 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
may 
not 
always 
be 
beneficial 
to 
a 
gig-economy

– 
still 
holds, 
although 
does 
so 
with 
boundary 
conditions 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
focal 
platform’s 


11For 
a 
tie-breaking 
rule, 
we 
assume 
that 
a 
worker 
will 
choose 
the 
focal 
platform 
if 
she 
is 
indierent 
between 
the 
focal 
platform 
and 
the 
competing 
one.

advantage 
in 
other 
dimensions 
and 
the 
labor 
demand 
correlation 
between 
the 
two 
platforms 
in 
the 
market. 
Second, 
the 
focal 
platform 
should 
refrain 
from 
adopting 
a 
more 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
when 
it 
has 
an 
advantage 
over 
its 
competitor 
in 
other 
dimensions 
(e.g., 
reputation), 
but 
the 
advantage 
is 
not 
too 
large. 
Intuitively, 
if 
the 
focal 
platform 
has 
a 
disadvantage 
in 
other 
dimensions, 
it 
is 
already 
hard 
for 
it 
to 
attract 
users 
even 
in 
the 
first 
period, 
making 
the 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
less 
prominent 
compared 
to 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect, 
which 
can 
help 
it 
attract 
additional 
demand. 
In 
this 
case, 
adopting 
a 
more 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
profitable 
because 
it 
can 
compensate 
for 
the 
focal 
platform’s 
disadvantage. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
when 
the 
focal 
platform 
has 
a 
su 
ciently 
large 
advantage 
in 
other 
dimensions, 
we 
find 
that 
it 
should 
also 
adopt 
a 
more 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
because 
its 
advantage 
in 
other 
dimensions 
is 
large 
enough 
to 
o 
set 
the 
possible 
unintended 
negative 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
from 
adopting 
the 
technology 
to 
prevent 
workers 
from 
switching 
to 
the 
competing 
platform. 
Third, 
strategically 
not 
adopting 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
can 
be 
more 
profitable 
for 
the 
focal 
platform 
when 
the 
correlation 
between 
the 
labor 
demands 
of 
the 
two 
platforms 
is 
positive 
(◊ 
> 
0) 
and 
is 
neither 
too 
large 
nor 
too 
small. 
The 
key 
intuition 
behind 
this 
result 
is 
related 
to 
when 
the 
possible 
negative 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
is 
more 
significant, 
or 
when 
a 
worker 
has 
the 
incentive 
to 
switch 
from 
the 
focal 
platform 
after 
receiving 
a 
poor-match 
(xL)in 
the 
first 
period. 
Clearly, 
a 
worker 
has 
no 
incentive 
to 
switch 
when 
the 
demand 
correlation 
is 
close 
to 
being 
perfect 
positive 
(i.e., 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
switch 
to 
a 
platform 
with 
similar 
demand 
but 
worse 
matching) 
or 
close 
to 
independence 
(i.e., 
there 
is 
no 
update 
about 
the 
demand 
on 
the 
other 
platform). 
However, 
the 
result 
that 
the 
worker 
is 
unlikely 
to 
leave 
upon 
receiving 
xL 
when 
the 
demand 
correlation 
is 
negative 
is 
counterintuitive. 
Note 
that 
although 
receiving 
xL 
is 
a 
worse 
signal 
than 
receiving 
xH 
, 
it 
is 
still 
better 
than 
receiving 
no 
assignment. 
Therefore, 
if 
the 
demands 
on 
the 
two 
platforms, 
p 
and 
q, 
are 
negatively 
correlated, 
upon 
receiving 
xL, 
then 
both 
the 
posterior 
probability 
of 
a 
very 
small 
q 
and 
that 
of 
a 
very 
large 
q 
increase. 
As 
a 
result, 
both 
the 
probability 
that 
an 
employer 
with 
xH 
appears 
on 
the 
competing 
platform 
in 
the 
second 
period 
and 
the 
probability 
that 
no 
employer 
appears 
increase. 
However, 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
former 
probability 
cannot 
o 
set 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
latter 
when 
the 
worker 
evaluates 
the 
second-period 
payo 
, 
because 
the 
job 
task 
with 
xH 
may 
not 
be 
assigned 
even 
if 
it 
appears, 
given 
the 
lack 
of 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
on 
the 
competing 
platform. 


4.5 
Interrelated 
Worker 
Demand 
In 
our 
main 
model, 
we 
assume 
that 
workers’ 
demands 
are 
independent; 
that 
is, 
workers’ 
potential 
markets 
do 
not 
overlap, 
such 
that 
each 
individual 
worker 
monopolizes 
her 
own 
market 
demand. 
In 
practice, 
workers’ 
potential 
markets 
may 
overlap 
and 
thus 
workers 
may 
engage 
in 
labor 
competition. 
In 
this 
case, 
while 
a 
worker 
may 
not 
know 
that 
other 
workers 
potentially 
are 
serving 
the 
same 
demand, 
the 
platform 
considers 
all 
the 
workers 
who 
can 
potentially 
take 
these 
jobs 
when 
it 
matches 
employers 


29 





and 
workers. 


We 
next 
take 
this 
demand 
interrelation 
into 
account 
and 
focus 
on 
a 
representative 
case 
of 
two 
workers 
and 
four 
potential 
employers 
on 
the 
platform.12 
We 
first 
examine 
the 
case 
in 
which 
workers 
do 
not 
know 
that 
other 
workers 
are 
serving 
the 
same 
demand 
when 
this 
competition 
information 
is 
not 
revealed 
by 
the 
platform. 
Later 
in 
Section 
5.2, 
we 
will 
examine 
how 
worker 
behavior 
and 
platform 
revenue 
are 
a 
ected 
if 
the 
platform 
reveals 
this 
competition 
information 
to 
workers. 


Each 
potential 
employer 
appears 
with 
a 
probability 
p, 
which 
again 
describes 
the 
demand 
condition 
(or 
the 
relative 
demand 
to 
supply). 
Among 
the 
four 
potential 
employers, 
two 
are 
a 
good 
match 
for 
the 
workers 
and 
generate 
a 
revenue 
of 
xH, 
whereas 
the 
other 
two 
matches 
are 
poor 
and 
only 
generate 
a 
revenue 
of 
xL. 
We 
derive 
the 
results 
for 
both 
when 
the 
two 
workers 
have 
homogeneous 
preferences 
(i.e., 
the 
same 
employer 
is 
considered 
as 
a 
good 
or 
poor 
match 
for 
both 
workers) 
and 
when 
the 
two 
workers’ 
preferences 
are 
di 
erentiated 
(i.e., 
one 
worker’s 
good-match 
employer 
is 
the 
other 
worker’s 
poor 
match). 


In 
the 
presence 
of 
interrelated 
worker 
demand, 
the 
gig-economy 
platform 
still 
assigns 
jobs 
randomly 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
not 
adopted, 
and 
assigns 
good-match 
employers 
to 
both 
workers 
whenever 
possible 
to 
maximize 
the 
revenue 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted. 
If 
the 
number 
of 
good-match 
employers 
appearing 
on 
the 
platform 
is 
lower 
than 
the 
number 
of 
workers, 
then 
each 
worker 
has 
the 
same 
chance 
to 
be 
assigned 
to 
a 
good-match 
employer, 
and 
the 
rest 
will 
serve 
a 
poor-match 
employer 
or 
even 
have 
no 
job 
assigned, 
depending 
on 
the 
total 
number 
of 
employers 
present. 
Whenever 
the 
total 
number 
of 
employers 
who 
actually 
appear 
is 
lower 
than 
the 
number 
of 
workers 
(e.g., 
two 
workers 
but 
only 
one 
employer), 
then 
the 
two 
workers 
will 
be 
assigned 
to 
the 
employer 
with 
equal 
probability. 


In 
the 
rest 
of 
this 
section, 
we 
discuss 
the 
workers’ 
participation 
decisions 
and 
the 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue 
if 
(1) 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted 
and 
(2) 
no 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
used, 
so 
we 
may 
show 
when 
a 
platform’s 
adoption 
of 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
can 
backfire, 
which 
demonstrates 
the 
robustness 
of 
our 
key 
insights 
with 
respect 
to 
worker 
competition. 
Let 
fi0ú

denote 
the 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue

and 
with 
the 
advanced 
matching 


rela 
and 
fiTú 
technology 
when 
workers’ 
demands 
are 
interrelated, 
respectively. 
Following 
the 
same 
analysis 
we 
used 
in 
Section 
3, 
we 
find 
that 
our 
results 
are 
in 
line 
with 
those 
of 
the 
main 
model; 
we 
summarize 
these 
results 
in 
the 
following 
proposition.

6. 
Suppose

possible 
scenarios 
for 
job

including 
assigning

good-match 
employers 
to 
workers, 
assigning 
both 
bad-match 
employers, 
assigning

and 
so 
on.

). 


Proposition 
6 
continues 
to 
show 
that 
adopting 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
may 
hurt 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
by 
undermining 
worker 
participation. 
Specifically, 
when 
the 
outside 
opportunity 
cost 
cis 
intermediate 
and 
the 
value 
xH 
of 
a 
good-match 
job 
is 
not 
too 
high 
relative 
to 
xL, 
the 
platform’s 
ex-ante 
expected 
revenue 
can 
be 
even 
lower 
when 
it 
adopts 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
than 
when 
it 
does 
not. 
This 
finding 
implies 
that 
the 
insights 
from 
our 
main 
model 
are 
robust 
to 
whether 
workers 
have 
independent 
demands 
or 
not. 


We 
can 
also 
observe 
that 
compared 
to 
the 
case 
when 
workers’ 
preferences 
are 
homogeneous, 
the 
region 
in 
which 
adopting 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
hurts 
the 
platform 
shrinks 
when 
work


215

ers 
have 
heterogeneous 
preferences 
(23 
L 
< 
L). 
This 
is 
because 
when 
workers’ 
preferences 
are 


22x 
121x 


heterogeneous, 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect 
from 
adopting 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
stronger. 
This 
result 
indicates 
that 
a 
platform 
is 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
hurt 
by 
technology 
adoption 
if 
workers’ 
preferences 
are 
more 
diversified. 


Mitigating 
the 
Possible 
Negative 
Eect 
of 
Advanced 
Matching 
Technology 
by 
Actively 
Revealing 
Information 


Our 
main 
model 
and 
extensions 
consistently 
show 
that 
using 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
can 
sometimes 
hurt 
a 
platform’s 
revenue. 
The 
anticipated 
benefit 
of 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
tenable 
only 
when 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect 
dominates 
the 
possible 
negative 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
if 
the 
revealed 
demand 
information 
discourages 
worker 
participation. 
In 
practice, 
gig-
economy 
platforms 
can 
reveal 
demand 
information 
to 
workers. 
For 
example, 
ride-hailing 
and 
delivery 
platforms 
provide 
workers 
with 
a 
“heat 
map” 
that 
reveals 
real-time 
demand 
in 
di 
erent 
areas 
of 
a 
city 
(Uber, 
2021; 
Instacart, 
2021; 
DoorDash, 
2022). 
The 
use 
of 
surge 
pricing 
can 
also 
be 
considered 
a 
demand 
signal. 
As 
competition 
from 
workers 
targeting 
the 
same 
demand 
can 
a 
ect 
job 
assignments, 
revealing 
competition 
information 
may 
also 
influence 
workers’ 
interpretation 
of 
demand 
information 
carried 
by 
assigned 
jobs 
and 
thus 
worker 
participation. 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
examine 
two 
approaches 
– 
revealing 
demand 
information 
and 
revealing 
competition 
information 
directly 
to 
workers 
– 
that 
could 
mitigate 
the 
negative 
e 
ect 
of 
matching 
technology 
for 
gig-economy 
platforms, 
and 
we 
compare 
the 
relative 
e 
ectiveness 
of 
these 
two 
approaches. 
To 
analyze 
this 
competition 
information, 
we 
use 
our 


31 





model 
from 
Section 
4.5 
with 
interrelated 
worker 
demand 
(and 
homogeneous 
worker 
preferences) 
as 
our 
benchmark. 


5.1 
Revealing 
Demand 
Information 
When 
demand 
information 
is 
not 
directly 
revealed 
by 
the 
platform, 
the 
worker 
cannot 
observe 
the 
market 
demand 
probability 
p 
before 
participating, 
but 
she 
can 
infer 
this 
information 
through 
a 
Bayesian 
manner 
after 
observing 
her 
first-period 
job 
assignment. 
When 
this 
indirect 
inference 
leads 
to 
an 
unfavorable 
outcome, 
the 
platform 
could 
instead 
reveal 
the 
demand 
information 
directly 
to 
the 
worker. 


We 
assume 
that 
the 
platform 
can 
commit 
to 
truthfully 
revealing 
demand 
information 
(i.e., 
p)to 
the 
worker.13 
The 
worker’s 
participation 
decision 
in 
the 
second 
period 
then 
will 
simply 
depend 
on 
the 
revealed 
p, 
but 
not 
on 
the 
matching 
outcome 
in 
the 
first 
period 
because 
the 
inference 
for 
p 
is 
no 
longer 
needed. 
We 
consider 
the 
case 
when 
the 
platform 
adopts 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
to 
match 
the 
two 
workers 
with 
the 
four 
potential 
employers. 
The 
worker 
participates 
in 
the 
second 
period 
if 
and 
only 
if 
the 
demand 
information 
p 
satisfies:

+ 
PrT 


where 
PrT 
= 
xH 
|p) 
(or 
PrT 
= 
xL|p)) 
is 
the 
probability 
that 
the 
worker 
thinks 
a

worker(x2 
worker(x2 


good-match 
(or 
poor-match) 
employer 
is 
assigned 
to 
her 
with 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
whose 
expressions 
are 
in 
equation 
(A7) 
of 
the 
Appendix. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
worker 
does 
not 
know 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
competitor, 
so 
she 
assumes 
she 
faces 
all 
four 
potential 
employers.

The

about 
whether

brought 
about 
by 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
advanced

as 
shown 
in

be 
alleviated 
by

The 
following

proposition 
answers 
this 
question. 


Proposition 
7. 
If 
the 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue 
is 
lower 
when 
it 
adopts 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
than 
when 
it 
does 
not, 
then 
the 
platform 
adopting 
the 
technology 
is 
better 
o� 
by 
truthfully 
revealing 
p 
to 
the 
worker 
(i.e., 
fiT 
ú

matching 
technology 
(fiT 
ú 
rela).

RD 
may 
still 
be 
less 
than 
fi0ú 


This 
proposition 
shows 
that 
when 
the 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
works 
against 
the 
platform’s 
benefit, 
the 
revealed 
demand 
information 
will 
mitigate 
the 
unfavorable 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
of 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
which 
increases 
platform 
revenue 
(i.e., 
fiT 
ú 


RD 
> 
fiT 
ú). 
However, 
in 
some 
cases 
when 
the 
demand 
condition 
is 
not 
good, 
revealing 
this 
information 
directly, 
even 
though 
it 
is 
better 
than 
letting 
the 
worker 
infer 
from 
the 
assigned 
matching 
outcome, 
still 
hurts 
platform 
revenue 
compared 
to 
when 
workers 
infer 
information 
from 
a 
randomly 
matched 
job 
assignment. 
Thus, 
we 
find 
that 
by 
truthfully 
revealing 
p, 
the 
platform 
may 
still 
be 
worse 
o 
compared 
to 
the 
case 
without 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology. 
Of 
course, 
the 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
enabled 
by 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
may 
sometimes 
work 
to 
the 
platform’s 
benefit 
(e.g., 
over-optimistic 
demand 
expectations). 
When 
this 
happens, 
directly 
revealing 
demand 
information 
may 
hurt 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
as 
well. 
Therefore, 
whether 
to 
commit 
to 
direct 
demand 
revelation 
is 
a 
strategy 
that 
platforms 
need 
to 
consider 
thoughtfully. 


5.2 
Revealing 
Competition 
Information 
In 
Section 
4.5, 
we 
assume 
that 
workers 
are 
not 
aware 
of 
other 
workers 
competing 
for 
the 
same 
labor 
demand 
when 
this 
information 
is 
not 
revealed 
by 
the 
platform. 
In 
this 
section, 
however, 
we 
analyze 
what 
happens 
if 
the 
platform 
instead 
chooses 
to 
reveal 
the 
number 
of 
workers 
competing 
for 
the 
same 
demand 
to 
workers. 
In 
this 
case, 
each 
worker 
knows 
that 
other 
workers 
on 
the 
platform 
are 
competing 
for 
the 
same 
potential 
labor 
demand. 
When 
a 
worker 
infers 
demand 
information 
from 
the 
first-period 
job 
assignment, 
she 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
e 
ect 
of 
competition 
on 
the 
type 
of 
assignment 
she 
receives. 
When 
she 
decides 
whether 
to 
continue 
participating 
in 
the 
second 
period, 
her 
expected 
payo 
for 
the 
second 
period 
not 
only 
depends 
on 
the 
inferred 
demand 
information, 
but 
also 
depends 
on 
her 
expectation 
of 
the 
other 
worker’s 
participation 
decision. 
We 
focus 
on 
the 
case 
in 
which 
the 
platform 
adopts 
the 
advanced 
technology 
for 
matching, 
as 
our 
interest 
is 
to 
examine 
whether 
revealing 
competition 
information 
can 
alleviate 
the 
possible 
negative 
e 
ect 
of 
advanced 
technology 
adoption. 
We 
develop 
the 
symmetric 
Nash 
Equilibrium 
(mixed 
strategy 
allowed) 
in 
Lemma 
4.

Given 
workers’ 
responses 
when 
competition 
information 
is 
revealed, 
we 
can 
calculate 
the 
expected 
revenue 
of 
the 
platform, 
denoted 
as 
fiT 
ú 


RC, 
and 
compare 
that 
to 
the 
revenue 
when 
no 
competition 
information 
is 
revealed 
in 
Section 
4.5 
(fiT 
ú 


rela). 
The 
following 
proposition 
gives 
the 
result 
of 
this 
comparison. 


Proposition 
8. 
If 
the 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue 
is 
lower 
when 
it 
adopts 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
than 
when 
it 
does 
not, 
then 
the 
platform 
adopting 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
no 
worse 
o� 
by 
revealing 
competition 
information 
to 
workers 
(i.e., 
fiT 
ú 
rela), 
but 
it 
may 
still 
be 
worse

Ø 
fiT

compared 
to 
the 
case 
without 
the

technology 
(fiT

RC 
may 
still 
be

than

Conventional 
wisdom 
suggests 
that 
revealing 
competition 
information 
to 
workers 
might 
discourage 
workers 
from 
continuing 
their 
work, 
as 
their 
expected 
payo 
is 
less 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
competition 
from 
peers. 
However, 
our 
analysis 
suggests 
that 
this 
argument 
may 
not 
be 
universally 
true. 
There 
are 
two 
factors 
that 
a 
worker 
needs 
to 
consider 
when 
she 
is 
making 
the 
participation 
decision: 
(1) 
competition 
from 
other 
workers, 
and 
(2) 
the 
estimated 
labor 
demand 
in 
the 
market. 
Revealing 
competition 
information 
indeed 
makes 
the 
former 
more 
salient 
and 
thus 
discourages 
a 
worker 
from 
participating, 


34 





but 
it 
also 
induces 
a 
worker 
to 
think 
more 
positively 
about 
the 
labor 
demand 
after 
seeing 
that 
the 
first-period 
assignment 
is 
a 
poor 
match. 
This 
is 
because 
competition 
serves 
as 
another 
reason 
for 
not 
getting 
a 
good 
match 
in 
the 
first 
period, 
and 
thus 
a 
worker 
may 
not 
blame 
demand 
after 
being 
assigned 
to 
a 
poor-match 
employer 
in 
the 
first 
period, 
thereby 
mitigating 
the 
unfavorable 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
in 
our 
main 
model. 


Now 
that 
we 
have 
examined 
two 
possible 
approaches 
to 
mitigate 
the 
potential 
negative 
e 
ect 
brought 
by 
advanced 
technology 
adoption, 
we 
next 
address 
the 
following 
question: 
which 
approach 
– 
revealing 
demand 
information, 
competition 
information, 
or 
both 
– 
is 
more 
e 
ective 
in 
mitigating 
the 
possible 
negative 
e 
ect? 
We 
answer 
this 
question 
in 
the 
following 
corollary. 


Corollary 
1. 
Among 
the 
choices 
of 
revealing 
demand 
information, 
competition 
information, 
or 
both, 
the 
platform 
benefits 
the 
most 
from 
only 
revealing 
demand 
information. 


Corollary 
1 
o 
ers 
two 
interesting 
observations. 
First, 
it 
indicates 
that 
revealing 
both 
demand 
and 
competition 
information 
is 
suboptimal 
for 
the 
platform. 
This 
is 
because 
when 
demand 
information 
is 
truthfully 
revealed 
to 
gig 
workers, 
they 
do 
not 
need 
to 
infer 
demand 
information 
from 
assigned 
jobs. 
Therefore, 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
unfavorable 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
is 
resolved. 
In 
this 
case, 
further 
revealing 
the 
competition 
information 
only 
demotivates 
workers 
from 
participating 
in 
the 
platform. 
Second, 
the 
corollary 
also 
points 
out 
that 
when 
matching 
technology 
induces 
an 
unfavorable 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect, 
revealing 
demand 
information 
is 
more 
e 
ective 
than 
revealing 
competition 
information 
in 
mitigating 
this 
e 
ect. 
In 
cases 
in 
which 
matching 
technology 
hurts 
the 
platform’s 
revenue, 
a 
possible 
negative 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
dominates 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect. 
While 
both 
approaches 
can 
mitigate 
this 
negative 
impact 
of 
matching 
technology, 
revealing 
competition 
information 
additionally 
discloses 
the 
presence 
of 
competition 
that 
workers 
might 
not 
have 
been 
aware 
of, 
thus 
discouraging 
them 
from 
participating 
as 
a 
result 
of 
competitive 
pressure. 


Advanced 
Matching 
Technology 
and 
Welfare 


In 
our 
previous 
sections, 
we 
have 
focused 
on 
the 
implications 
of 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
adoption 
on 
platform 
revenue. 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
analyze 
the 
impact 
of 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
on 
worker 
surplus 
as 
well 
as 
the 
total 
welfare 
of 
the 
platform 
and 
the 
worker, 
which 
could 
be 
of 
interest 
to 
policy-makers. 
Investigating 
total 
welfare 
also 
allows 
us 
to 
examine 
whether 
the 
change 
in 
platform 
revenue 
results 
from 
the 
redistribution 
of 
welfare 
across 
di 
erent 
parties. 


Equation 
(14) 
gives 
the 
expression 
for 
the 
platform’s 
ex-ante 
expected 
revenue 
(filú). 
For 
worker 
surplus, 
two 
things 
are 
di 
erent. 
First, 
the 
worker 
gets 
a 
” 
proportion 
of 
the 
total 
revenue, 
instead 
of 
1 
≠ 
” 
for 
the 
platform. 
Second, 
unlike 
the 
platform, 
which 
earns 
no 
revenue 
if 
the 
worker 
does 
not 
participate, 
the 
worker 
gets 
the 
value 
c 
from 
her 
outside 
option 
if 
she 
does 
not 
participate 
on 


35 





the 
platform. 
Considering 
these 
two 
modifications 
for 
equation 
(14), 
we 
derive 
the 
worker’s 
ex-ante 
expected 
surplus, 
denoted 
by 
wlú,where 
l 
oe 
{0,T},to

of 
the 
platform 
and 
the

denoted

oe 
{0,T}, 
is 
thus 
given 
by: 


lú

TWlú 
= 
filú 
+ 
w. 
(23) 


We 
analyze 
both 
cases 
where 
the 
commission 
rate 
for 
workers 
(”) 
is 
exogenously 
given 
and 
where 
the 
rate 
is 
endogenously 
decided 
by 
the 
platform. 
Our 
results 
and 
associated 
intuition 
are 
slightly 
di 
erent 
for 
the 
two 
cases. 
We 
summarize 
our 
results 
in 
the 
following 
proposition 
and 
Figure 
A6 
in 
the 
Appendix. 


Proposition 
9. 
Compared 
to 
the 
case 
when 
no 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted, 
the 
adoption 
of 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
never 
reduces 
worker 
surplus 
if 
the 
commission 
rate 
is 
exogenously 
given, 
but 
may 
do 
so 
if 
the 
commission 
rate 
is 
endogenously 
decided 
by 
the 
platform. 
The 
adoption 
of 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
may 
reduce 
the 
total 
welfare 
of 
the 
platform 
and 
the 
worker, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
the 
commission 
rate 
is 
exogenous 
or 
endogenous. 


In 
this 
proposition, 
we 
first 
find 
that 
worker 
surplus 
is 
always 
higher 
when 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted 
than 
when 
it 
is 
not, 
if 
the 
commission 
rate 
is 
exogenous. 
This 
result 
is 
intuitive 
because 
the 
two 
e 
ects 
associated 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
matching 
technology 
(i.e., 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
and 
information 
revelation 
e 
ects), 
both 
benefit 
the 
worker: 
the 
first 
e 
ect 
improves 
the 
match 
and 
the 
second 
e 
ect 
helps 
the 
worker 
makes 
a 
better 
participation 
decision. 
However, 
the 
result 
can 
be 
di 
erent 
if 
the 
commission 
rate 
is 
endogenously 
determined 
by 
the 
platform. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
platform 
has 
another 
tool 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
worker’s 
strategic 
behavior 
induced 
by 
the 
additional 
information 
that 
is 
revealed 
by 
the 
matching 
outcome, 
thus 
limiting 
the 
worker’s 
surplus. 
Therefore, 
with 
an 
endogenous 
commission 
rate, 
worker 
surplus 
sometimes 
goes 
down 
due 
to 
the 
adoption 
of 
advanced 
matching 
technology. 
Furthermore, 
we 
find 
that 
the 
total 
welfare 
of 
the 
platform 
and 
the 
worker 
may 
decrease 
after 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
introduced. 
This 
suggests 
that 
the 
decrease 
in 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
is 
not 
merely 
a 
redistribution 
of 
the 
welfare. 
Even 
when 
the 
worker 
benefits 
from 
the 
adoption 
of 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
the 
increase 
in 
worker 
surplus 
is 
sometimes 
not 
su 
cient 
to 
compensate 
for 
a 
platform’s 
revenue 
loss. 
These 
results 
suggest 
an 
ine 
ciency 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
worker’s 
strategic 
behavior 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
advanced 
technology’s 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect, 
and 
we 
should 
consider 
this 
e 
ect 
not 
only 
from 
the 
platform’s 
perspective 
but 
also 
from 
the 
total 
welfare’s 
perspective.

Figure 
A6 
also 
provides 
an 
interesting 
observation. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
an 
exogenous 
commission 
rate, 
we 
find 
that 
in 
the 
region 
where 
the 
total 
welfare 
goes 
down 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted, 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
also 
decreases; 
that 
is, 
TWT 
ú 
<TW0ú 
implies 
fiT 
ú 
< 
fi0ú.This 
is 
because 
the 
worker’s 
surplus 
is 
never 
hurt 
in 
this 
case. 
This 
observation 
implies 
that 
a 
policy-maker 
may 
not 
need 
to 
provide 
additional 
incentives 
for 
the 
platform 
to 
improve 
welfare 
after 
introducing 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology, 
as 
the 
platform 
already 
has 
an 
internal 
incentive 
to 
mitigate 
such 
a 
loss. 
However, 
when 
the 
platform 
adjusts 
its 
commission 
rate 
based 
on 
its 
matching 
technology’s 
capability, 
in 
the 
region 
where 
total 
welfare 
goes 
down 
when 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted, 
the 
platform’s 
revenue 
does 
not 
necessarily 
decrease. 
This 
suggests 
that 
there 
may 
be 
a 
need 
for 
regulation 
on 
the 
commission 
rate 
or 
platform 
pricing 
policies 
to 
align 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
platform 
with 
what 
is 
good 
with 
respect 
to 
total 
welfare, 
such 
that 
the 
platform’s 
decision 
to 
adopt 
the 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
will 
not 
hurt 
total 
welfare. 


Concluding 
Remarks 


As 
the 
gig 
economy 
is 
rapidly 
expanding, 
advanced 
technologies 
are 
being 
widely 
adopted 
to 
evaluate 
and 
assign 
job 
tasks 
more 
optimally 
to 
workers. 
This 
study 
provides 
a 
broader 
and 
more 
complete 
understanding 
of 
the 
landscape 
of 
interactions 
between 
human 
workers 
and 
technologies. 
It 
does 
so 
by 
formulating 
a 
modeling 
framework 
as 
a 
foundation 
to 
study 
the 
human-technology 
interactions 
in 
the 
context 
of 
gig-economy 
platforms; 
in 
these 
platforms, 
human 
workers 
can 
update 
their 
beliefs 
about 
uncertain 
labor 
demand 
revealed 
through 
matching 
outcomes 
in 
a 
Bayesian 
manner 
and 
decide 
whether 
to 
participate 
on 
the 
platforms. 
Contrary 
to 
the 
expectation 
that 
gig-economy 
platforms 
can 
always 
boost 
revenue 
substantially 
by 
utilizing 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
to 
enhance 
matching 
quality 
between 
gig 
workers 
and 
employers, 
we 
show 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
applying 
a 
better 
matching 
for 
managing 
human 
workers 
on 
platforms 
does 
not 
increase 
revenue. 
Our 
results 
are 
robust 
to 
alternative 
model 
assumptions 
regarding 
conditional 
revenue 
sharing 
and 
both 
platform 
and 
worker 
competitions. 
We 
also 
examine 
the 
optimal 
level 
of 
improvement 
in 
matching 
accuracy 
for 
gig-economy 
platforms, 
putting 
aside 
the 
cost 
consideration, 
and 
identify 
two 
approaches 
that 
can 
remedy 
the 
unanticipated 
e 
ect 
of 
a 
better 
matching 
technology. 
Our 
study 
provides 
valuable 
insights 
regarding 
the 
overall 
impacts 
that 
the 
choice 
of 
matching 
technology 
and 
response 
to 
the 
matching 
technology 
by 
human 
workers 
can 
have 
on 
workplaces 
enabled 
by 
gig-economy 
platforms. 


Advances 
in 
artificial 
intelligence 
(AI), 
especially 
those 
in 
machine 
learning 
algorithms 
and 
its 
subfield 
of 
deep 
learning, 
increasingly 
help 
transform 
business 
practices 
and 
the 
platform 
economy 
(Brynjolfsson 
et 
al., 
2019; 
Lou 
and 
Wu, 
2021; 
Zhou 
and 
Zou, 
2022). 
Some 
speculate 
that 
a 
smart 
AI-enabled 
matching 
technology 
has 
learning 
capability 
and 
can 
consider 
the 
potential 
negative 
infor


37 





mation 
revelation 
e 
ect 
when 
assigning 
job 
tasks 
(e.g., 
intentionally 
assigning 
suboptimal 
job 
tasks 
to 
workers). 
However, 
unless 
the 
technology 
is 
permanently 
downgraded 
to 
a 
level 
that 
we 
find 
optimal 
in 
our 
model 
extension 
(in 
Section 
4.3), 
misleading 
workers 
to 
believe 
in 
a 
matching 
quality 
that 
is 
lower 
than 
its 
actual 
state 
is 
unsustainable; 
for 
example, 
it 
could 
trigger 
distrust 
of 
workers 
on 
platform 
operations 
and 
increase 
worker 
churn. 
Gig 
workers 
have 
already 
expressed 
displeasure 
and 
aversion 
to 
being 
manipulated 
by 
AI 
or 
algorithms 
more 
broadly 
(Möhlmann 
and 
Henfridsson, 
2019). 
Therefore, 
reputable 
platforms 
should 
not 
pursue 
strategies 
grounded 
in 
misperception 
and 
manipulation. 
Furthermore, 
AI 
can 
only 
process 
given 
information 
and 
cannot 
change 
demand 
conditions. 
In 
a 
market 
with 
low 
labor 
demand, 
there 
may 
simply 
be 
no 
good-match 
job 
tasks 
for 
AI 
to 
recommend. 
This 
inevitable 
choice, 
unfortunately, 
conveys 
information 
about 
the 
unfavorable 
demand 
condition. 
This 
negative 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
driven 
by 
low 
labor 
demand 
cannot 
be 
fully 
alleviated 
by 
AI, 
even 
if 
AI 
anticipates 
workers’ 
strategic 
behavior. 


Theoretical 
Contributions: 
The 
literature 
has 
focused 
on 
platform-enabled 
market 
design 
to 
reduce 
transaction 
costs 
and 
e 
ciently 
use 
information 
to 
match 
employers 
and 
workers 
(Einav 
et 
al., 
2016). 
Researchers 
are 
interested 
in 
studying 
how 
digital 
technologies 
can 
be 
used 
to 
motivate 
workers 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
gig 
economy 
and 
enhance 
market 
e 
ciency 
(Fradkin, 
2017; 
He 
et 
al., 
2021; 
Horton, 
2017). 
Recent 
developments 
in 
digital 
technologies, 
such 
as 
those 
in 
the 
area 
of 
data 
analytics 
and 
matching 
learning 
(or 
AI 
in 
general), 
have 
substantially 
enhanced 
the 
quality 
of 
worker-employer 
matching 
and 
gig-economy 
platforms’ 
overall 
operational 
performance 
(Wu 
et 
al., 
2019, 
2020; 
Hitt 
et 
al., 
2021). 
However, 
little 
attention 
is 
paid 
to 
possible 
unintended 
consequences 
and 
whether 
improved 
matching 
quality 
can 
indeed 
help 
platforms 
obtain 
higher 
revenue. 


We 
contribute 
to 
the 
literature 
by 
revealing 
that 
a 
better 
matching 
technology, 
although 
enhancing 
the 
quality 
of 
matching 
between 
workers 
and 
employers, 
functions 
as 
a 
double-edged 
sword 
in 
the 
gig 
economy. 
To 
the 
best 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
our 
study 
is 
the 
first 
to 
provide 
a 
comprehensive 
model 
that 
systematically 
examines 
the 
impact 
and 
implications 
of 
adopting 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
on 
a 
gig-economy 
platform. 
As 
technologies 
become 
more 
adept 
at 
processing 
information 
about 
the 
supply 
and 
demand 
of 
workers 
and 
their 
activities, 
information 
about 
labor 
demand, 
especially 
when 
it 
is 
low, 
can 
be 
unintentionally 
revealed 
to 
workers 
through 
their 
matching 
outcomes. 
This 
could 
encourage 
workers 
not 
to 
continue 
participating 
in 
the 
gig-economy 
platform 
as 
anticipated 
and 
thus 
lower 
platform 
revenue. 
Our 
model 
considers 
the 
crucial 
factors 
in 
decision 
making 
about 
a 
worker’s 
participation 
in 
the 
platform; 
these 
factors 
include 
beliefs 
updated 
by 
information 
revealed 
in 
jobs 
assigned 
by 
matching 
technology 
through 
a 
Bayesian 
manner, 
expected 
payo 
s 
associated 
with 
participation, 
and 
opportunity 
costs 
that 
can 
be 
influenced 
by 
platform 
competition. 


In 
addition, 
we 
extend 
the 
emerging 
literature 
on 
algorithmic 
management 
in 
the 
gig 
economy. 
The 
findings 
derived 
from 
our 
model 
can 
deepen 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
“good 
bad 
job” 
phenomenon 


38 





linked 
to 
gig 
work 
empowered 
by 
algorithmic 
technologies. 
While 
job 
tasks 
are 
bounded 
and 
the 
autonomy 
of 
gig 
workers 
can 
be 
squelched 
by 
algorithmic 
technologies, 
a 
sense 
of 
autonomy 
can 
also 
be 
further 
engendered 
by 
algorithmic 
controls, 
in 
addition 
to 
flexible 
work 
arrangements 
o 
ered 
in 
the 
gig 
workplace 
(Cameron, 
2020; 
Manyika 
et 
al., 
2016). 
Our 
model 
leverages 
the 
notion 
of 
“algorithmic 
imaginary” 
to 
examine 
the 
perception 
of 
matching 
technologies 
by 
gig 
workers, 
as 
well 
as 
their 
behavior 
in 
making 
sense 
of 
information 
from 
the 
matching 
outcomes 
(Zhang 
et 
al., 
2022). 
Thus, 
our 
model 


o 
ers 
a 
more 
nuanced 
way 
to 
examine 
how 
gig 
workers 
can 
navigate 
the 
tension 
between 
job 
tasks 
assigned 
by 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
and 
autonomy 
by 
strategically 
engaging 
with 
job 
tasks 
and 
using 
them 
to 
make 
informed 
participation 
decisions. 
Boundary 
Conditions 
and 
Practical 
Implications: 
We 
next 
discuss 
the 
boundary 
conditions 
of 
our 
model 
and 
link 
them 
to 
reality. 
Our 
study 
also 
o 
er 
several 
practical 
implications 
for 
policymakers 
and 
practitioners 
who 
use 
advanced 
matching 
technologies 
in 
the 
gig 
economy. 


First, 
we 
caution 
gig-economy 
platforms 
about 
the 
unintended 
negative 
consequences 
of 
adopting 
a 
technology 
with 
better 
matching 
quality. 
A 
perfectly 
accurate 
matching 
technology 
is 
not 
necessarily 
optimal, 
even 
if 
costs 
to 
acquire 
or 
develop 
the 
technology 
are 
nominal. 
Such 
performance 
results 
from 
the 
possible 
negative 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
as 
human 
workers 
interact 
with 
demand 
signals 
carried 
in 
assigned 
jobs 
from 
the 
platform’s 
matching 
results. 
This 
negative 
impact 
likely 
occurs 
when 
di 
erent 
types 
of 
matches 
(i.e., 
“good-match” 
and 
“poor-match” 
job 
tasks) 
do 
not 
di 
er 
significantly 
in 
value 
to 
workers. 
For 
example, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
food 
delivery 
platform 
in 
a 
small 
town 
where 
most 
restaurants 
are 
located 
fairly 
close 
to 
one 
another, 
a 
good 
match 
and 
a 
poor 
match 
do 
not 
di 
er 
too 
much 
in 
value; 
thus, 
the 
matching 
enhancement 
e 
ect 
of 
the 
technology 
is 
not 
very 
significant. 
However, 
the 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
can 
still 
occur 
when 
a 
driver 
receives 
a 
poor 
match, 
which 
could 
hurt 
the 
gig-economy 
platform’s 
expected 
revenue. 
Even 
if 
the 
platform 
has 
enough 
market 
power 
to 
adjust 
its 
revenue 
split 
with 
its 
workers, 
applying 
advanced 
technologies 
such 
as 
AI 
for 
matching 
may 
still 
result 
in 
lower 
revenue 
for 
the 
platform. 
As 
technologies 
and 
their 
associated 
algorithms 
continue 
to 
improve 
their 
matching 
quality 
and 
capability, 
the 
adverse 
e 
ect 
associated 
with 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
that 
we 
identify 
in 
our 
study 
could 
even 
be 
amplified 
and, 
thus, 
should 
not 
be 
overlooked. 
Therefore, 
developing 
a 
matching 
system 
that 
can 
analyze 
all 
available 
information 
and 
exhibit 
superior 
matching 
performance 
is 
not 
always 
the 
best 
course 
of 
action 
for 
improving 
platform 
revenue. 
Gig-economy 
platforms 
that 
do 
not 
demonstrate 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages 
of 
matching 
technologies 
could 
misallocate 
valuable 
resources 
to 
conditions 
for 
which 
the 
technologies 
provide 
minimal 
benefits 
and 
possible 
negative 
consequences. 
To 
avoid 
these 
costly 
mistakes, 
platforms 
should 
adopt 
matching 
technologies 
more 
strategically, 
by 
taking 
into 
account 
their 
potential 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect. 


Second, 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
competition 
between 
platforms 
in 
the 
gig 
economy, 
we 
show 
that 
when 
a 


39 





focal 
platform 
has 
a 
su 
ciently 
large 
advantage 
over 
competitors 
in 
dimensions 
other 
than 
monetary 
compensation 
(e.g., 
reputation, 
service 
quality) 
or 
is 
disadvantaged 
in 
these 
dimensions, 
adopting 
a 
more 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
can 
be 
beneficial. 
For 
example, 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
market 
share 
of 
ride-hailing 
companies 
in 
the 
U.S.,14 
Uber 
accounts 
for 
over 
half 
of 
total 
market 
share 
and 
dominates 
Lyft 
in 
some 
cities 
(e.g., 
Houston)15 
In 
this 
case, 
Lyft 
can 
benefit 
from 
developing 
and 
adopting 
a 
better 
matching 
technology 
because 
it 
can 
compensate 
for 
its 
disadvantage 
in 
the 
areas 
in 
which 
Uber 
dominates. 
Whether 
Uber 
can 
benefit 
from 
a 
more 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
depends 
on 
whether 
Uber’s 
advantage 
in 
other 
dimensions 
is 
large 
enough 
to 
o 
set 
the 
possible 
unintended 
negative 
information 
revelation 
e 
ect 
from 
adopting 
technology 
to 
prevent 
workers 
from 
switching 
to 
a 
competing 
platform. 


Third, 
gig-economy 
platforms 
should 
make 
e 
orts 
to 
attract 
workers 
with 
heterogeneous 
preferences, 
as 
we 
show 
that 
a 
platform 
is 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
hurt 
by 
adopting 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
if 
workers’ 
preferences 
are 
more 
diversified. 
In 
Uber’s 
case, 
if 
riders 
and 
drivers 
are 
located 
in 
a 
scattered 
manner 
and 
drivers 
prefer 
riders 
closer 
to 
them, 
then 
di 
erent 
drivers 
may 
have 
heterogeneous 
preferences 
for 
riders. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
is 
also 
possible 
that 
drivers 
may 
homogeneously 
want 
to 
avoid 
picking 
up 
a 
rider 
in 
areas 
with 
heavy 
tra 
c. 
Our 
findings 
suggest 
that 
Uber 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
hurt 
by 
adopting 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
if 
the 
matching 
is 
mainly 
about 
avoiding 
heavy 
tra 
c 
rather 
than 
about 
reducing 
traveling 
distance. 


Fourth, 
we 
provide 
immediately 
actionable 
guidance 
and 
show 
that 
gig-economy 
platforms 
adopting 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
to 
match 
workers 
and 
their 
employers 
could 
directly 
disclose 
some 
information 
about 
labor 
supply 
and 
demand 
to 
workers 
in 
order 
to 
mitigate 
negative 
consequences 
caused 
by 
technology 
adoption. 
Platforms 
can 
benefit 
more 
from 
revealing 
demand 
information 
compared 
to 
worker 
competition 
information. 
In 
practice, 
we 
observe 
that 
gig-economy 
platforms 
provide 
workers 
with 
a 
”heat 
map” 
that 
reveals 
real-time 
demand 
in 
di 
erent 
areas 
of 
a 
city 
(Uber, 
2021; 
Instacart, 
2021; 
DoorDash, 
2022), 
but 
they 
generally 
do 
not 
allow 
workers 
to 
see 
how 
many 
competing 
workers 
are 
near 
them, 
consistent 
with 
the 
optimal 
strategy 
that 
our 
results 
suggest. 
The 
information 
disclosure 
strategy 
could 
help 
workers 
better 
understand 
the 
labor 
market 
when 
they 
receive 
matching 
outcomes 
and 
decide 
whether 
to

their 
workers, 
depending 
on 
whether 
the 
commission 
rate 
is 
exogenously 
or 
endogenously 
determined.16 
Based 
on 
our 
findings, 
policy-makers 
may 
not 
need 
to 
interfere 
if 
the 
commission 
rate 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
matching 
technology, 
as 
a 
platform’s 
incentive 
to 
choose 
a 
strategy 
that 
also 
benefits 
total 
welfare 
is 
internalized. 
However, 
if 
a 
platform 
has 
su 
cient 
market 
power 
to 
decide 
how 
the 
revenue 
is 
split 
between 
the 
platform 
and 
workers, 
then 
a 
regulation 
on 
the 
commission 
rate 
may 
be 
needed, 
since 
the 
incentive 
of 
the 
platform 
may 
not 
always 
be 
aligned 
with 
what 
is 
good 
for 
total 
welfare. 


Overall, 
our 
insights 
from 
this 
study 
can 
enrich 
collective 
understandings 
of 
managing 
both 
intended 
and 
unintended 
outcomes 
derived 
from 
better 
matching 
technologies. 


Limitations 
and 
Future 
Research 
Directions: 
This 
study 
has 
two 
limitations, 
which 
may 
indicate 
directions 
for 
future 
research. 
First, 
in 
our 
model 
extension, 
we 
examine 
endogenous 
opportunity 
costs, 
which 
can 
arise 
partly 
because 
a 
worker 
can 
switch 
to 
another 
competing 
platform. 
While 
our 
study 
is 
among 
the 
first 
to 
point 
out 
the 
potential 
downside 
of 
adopting 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
in 
that 
scenario, 
future 
research 
can 
extend 
this 
consideration 
and 
further 
examine 
the 
dynamics 
of 
the 
competition, 
including 
how 
platforms 
can 
strategically 
decide 
whether 
to 
advance 
matching 
technology, 
assess 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
they 
advance 
the 
technology, 
and 
determine 
how 
to 
apply 
the 
technology 
in 
the 
matching 
process. 


Second, 
we 
do 
not 
model 
strategic 
employers 
and 
thus 
do 
not 
consider 
their 
welfare 
explicitly 
in 
this 
study. 
We 
deliberately 
focus 
on 
the 
strategic 
behavior 
of 
workers 
instead 
of 
employers, 
because 
currently 
on 
gig-economy 
platforms, 
workers 
usually 
are 
more 
critical 
and 
have 
better 
outside 
options 
than 
employers.17 
That 
said, 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
strategic 
behavior 
of 
employers 
in 
our 
model, 
we 
anticipate 
that 
the 
two 
e 
ects 
we 
examine 
in 
our 
main 
model 
can 
influence 
employers 
similarly 
to 
those 
for 
the 
platform. 
A 
key 
mechanism 
behind 
our 
main 
result 
is 
that 
under 
some 
circumstances, 
workers 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
leave 
the 
platform 
upon 
observing 
a 
poor 
match 
in 
the 
first 
period 
in 
the 
case 
when 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
is 
adopted 
compared 
to 
the 
case 
when 
it 
is 
not, 
because 
of 
the 
extra 
information 
carried 
by 
better-matched 
outcomes. 
If 
we 
also 
model 
employers’ 
participation 
decisions, 
they 
will 
also 
likely 
leave 
if 
they 
anticipate 
that 
workers 
will 
leave 
the 
platform, 
leaving 
an 
insu 
cient 
labor 
supply 
in 
the 
second 
period. 
In 
other 
words, 
when 
workers 
are 
inclined 
to 
leave, 


16For 
some 
platforms 
in 
the 
gig 
economy, 
the 
commission 
rate 
has 
not 
changed 
frequently 
in 
the 
past 
few 
years. 
For 
example, 
Uber 
currently 
charges 
drivers 
25% 
of 
total 
fares 
(See 
https://www.uber.com/gh/en/drive/basics/tracking 
-your-earnings/, 
accessed 
on 
January 
16, 
2023), 
which 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
rate 
in 
2018, 
according 
to 
a 
report 
by 
Mishel 
(2018) 
claiming 
that 
“Uber 
takes 
a 
25 
percent 
commission 
from 
the 
fares 
after 
deducting 
a 
‘booking 
fee’ 
per 
trip 
of 
roughly 
$1.55”. 
Other 
web 
resources 
such 
as 
RideGuru 
(See 
https://ride.guru/content/resources/driver-payout-take-h 
ome, 
accessed 
on 
January 
16, 
2023) 
also 
oer 
information 
about 
relatively 
stable 
commission 
structures. 
Of 
course, 
we 
cannot 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
some 
platforms 
may 
adjust 
their 
commission 
rates 
for 
various 
considerations. 
Thus, 
both 
cases 
(when 
the 
commission 
rate 
is 
both 
exogenously 
and 
endogenously 
determined) 
are 
considered 
in 
our 
study. 


17See, 
for 
example, 
Marshall 
(2021). 
The 
platforms, 
as 
two-sided 
markets, 
enlarge 
themselves 
by 
subsidizing 
one 
side 
of 
the 
market 
and 
charging 
the 
other 
side 
the 
full 
price 
(Parker 
and 
Van 
Alstyne, 
2005; 
Rochet 
and 
Tirole, 
2006). 
Solon 
(2017) 
highlights 
that 
Uber 
could 
not 
operate 
without 
a 
critical 
mass 
of 
drivers, 
and 
the 
company 
provides 
about 
one-thousand-dollar 
sign-up 
and 
referral 
bonuses 
to 
attract 
workers. 
Workers 
are 
rewarded 
by 
dynamically 
priced 
fares 
paid 
by 
employers 
on 
the 
platforms 
as 
well. 


41 





employers 
are 
also 
likely 
to 
leave 
and 
earn 
a 
zero 
surplus, 
reinforcing 
the 
result 
in 
our 
main 
model. 
Future 
research 
can 
further 
validate 
our 
speculation 
by 
explicitly 
accounting 
for 
the 
role 
of 
employers 
as 
well 
as 
their 
interactions 
with 
employees 
and 
the 
platform, 
and 
hence 
investigate 
the 
impact 
of 
adopting 
an 
advanced 
matching 
technology 
on 
employer 
surplus.
